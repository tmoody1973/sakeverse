## Amabuki Shuzo Co. Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1688-1704 (Genroku era)  
**Founder:** Unknown  
**Location:** Miyaki-cho, Miyaki-gun, Saga Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Flower yeast sake brewing, utilizing yeast strains extracted from various flowers (e.g., abelia, marigold, sunflower) to create unique flavor profiles.  

### History

Amabuki Shuzo Co. Ltd. is a historic sake brewery located in Miyaki-cho, Miyaki-gun, Saga Prefecture, in the northern part of Kyushu, Japan. The brewery's name, "Amabuki," is inspired by the magnificent appearance of Mount Amabuki, which is situated to the northeast of the brewery's location. The brewery was established during the Genroku era (1688-1704), making it one of the oldest sake breweries in Saga Prefecture with a history spanning over 300 years. The brewery began its operations by utilizing surplus rice from the fertile Saga Plain, which is still a primary source for their sake-brewing rice today. The brewery also draws on the mild river-bed water from the nearby Sefuri-Tensan areas, a crucial element in their brewing process.

The brewery's long history is characterized by a deep respect for traditional brewing skills passed down through generations, combined with a spirit of innovation. While the name of the original founder is not explicitly mentioned in readily available English or Japanese sources, the current representative is Sotaro Kinoshita, who is the 11th-generation head of the brewery. His leadership has been instrumental in the brewery's modern-day distinction. The brewery's philosophy centers on earnestly creating good sake by bringing together the blessings of nature, including the excellent climate for sake brewing in the region.

Amabuki Shuzo is a national pioneer in the use of **flower yeast** in sake brewing, which is their most significant specialty and a major modern milestone. This unique method involves using yeast strains extracted from various flowers, such as abelia, marigold, and sunflower, instead of the typical sake yeast cultured from sake mash. This innovation, which was developed in collaboration with Professor Hisayasu Nakata of the Tokyo University of Agriculture, allows Amabuki to produce sakes with distinct and individualistic flavor profiles, ranging from fruity and sharp to sophisticated and robust. This commitment to combining traditional techniques with cutting-edge, nature-inspired innovation has cemented Amabuki's reputation in the sake world.

The brewery continues to operate from its historic location, maintaining its dedication to quality and safety. By leveraging local resources—the sake-brewing rice from the Saga Plain and the soft water from the Sefuri Mountains—and their unique flower yeast, Amabuki Shuzo is committed to enriching the relaxing times of its customers. The brewery's enduring legacy is a testament to its ability to honor its 300-year history while embracing modern, distinctive brewing methods.

## Asabiraki Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1871  
**Founder:** Genzo Murai, seventh-generation samurai of the Nanbu Clan  
**Location:** Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Sake brewed with "Daijishimizu" spring water, selected as one of the 100 best waters in the Heisei Era. The brewery is also a major center for the Nanbu Toji tradition.  

### History

Asabiraki Co., Ltd. (あさ開酒造) was founded in 1871 (Meiji 4) in Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture, by Murai Genzo, the seventh-generation head of the Murai family. Genzo Murai was a former samurai of the Nanbu Clan who, following the Meiji Restoration and the subsequent Sword Abolishment Edict, transitioned from the life of a warrior to that of a merchant. He established the brewery, originally named "Murai Honke," in the Natayacho district of Morioka. The name "Asabiraki," which translates to "opening the morning," was inspired by a waka poem in the ancient Japanese poetry collection, the Manyoshu, which describes a boat setting out early in the morning. This name was chosen to symbolize both the founder's personal new beginning and the dawn of the new Meiji era.

The brewery quickly established itself, driven by the founder's entrepreneurial spirit and the rich natural resources of the Tohoku region. Over the decades, Asabiraki expanded its operations, opening a Tokyo office in 1975 and establishing the Showa Asahi Brewery in 1988. A significant milestone was reached in 1991 with the completion of a new product factory and head office, which further cemented its position as a leading sake producer in Iwate Prefecture. The brewery has also embraced modern commerce, launching its official online shop in 2004 to reach a wider audience.

Asabiraki's reputation is built on its commitment to quality, particularly its use of "Daijishimizu" spring water, which flows from the brewery's premises and has been selected as one of the "100 Best Waters of the Heisei Era." Furthermore, the brewery is deeply connected to the Nanbu Toji tradition, one of Japan's largest and most respected schools of master brewers, who oversee the meticulous brewing process. This dedication to excellence has resulted in numerous accolades, including winning the Gold Medal at the Annual Japan Sake Awards multiple times, with the official website noting 25 wins since the Heisei era.

Today, Asabiraki Co., Ltd. continues to honor its historical roots while innovating for the future. It remains a cornerstone of the local community in Morioka, offering brewery tours and a shop, and its products are celebrated both domestically and internationally. The brewery's enduring success is a testament to its founding spirit: to "open the era and open the heart," constantly looking to the future while overcoming challenges.

## Asahi-Shuzo Sake Brewing Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1830  
**Founder:** The brewery was founded by the Hirasawa family in 1830 under the trade name Kubotaya. Yonosuke Hirasawa, a descendant of the founding family, became the first president when the company was formally incorporated as Asahi Shuzo Co., Ltd. in 1920.  
**Location:** Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneered the *tanrei karakuchi* (crisp, clean, and dry finish) style of sake with the launch of the *Kubota* brand in 1985. Focuses on continuous innovation and quality control, including the establishment of an agricultural corporation for sake rice cultivation.  

### History

Asahi-Shuzo Sake Brewing Co., Ltd. traces its origins to the year 1830 (Tenpo 1), when it was established as a small sake brewery named "Kubotaya" in the village of Asahimura, which is now part of Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture [1] [2]. The brewery was founded by the Hirasawa family, who recognized the ideal environment for sake production in the region, characterized by its rich rice fields, wooded mountains, and abundant pure groundwater [3]. For nearly a century, the brewery operated under the Kubotaya trade name, building a reputation for quality sake, primarily under the *Asahiyama* label [4].

A major milestone occurred in 1920 (Taisho 9) when the brewery was formally incorporated as Asahi Shuzo Co., Ltd., with Yonosuke Hirasawa, a member of the founding family, serving as its first president [1]. Hirasawa was a significant figure, commissioning the elaborate Shoraikaku Villa around 1930, which served as the family home and is now recognized as a National Important Cultural Property [1] [3]. Throughout the 20th century, the company focused on modernization, including the purchase of enamel tanks in 1929 to gradually phase out wooden vats, and the completion of the second brewery building in 1974, achieving 100% self-brewed sake production [1].

The brewery's most significant contribution to the sake world came in 1985 with the launch of the *Kubota* brand, named after its original trade name [4]. This brand was a direct response to the changing culinary landscape and consumer preferences, pioneering the *tanrei karakuchi* (crisp, clean, and dry finish) style of sake [5]. This new style revolutionized the market, which had previously been dominated by richer, sweeter sakes, and established Asahi-Shuzo as a leader in the premium *ginjo* category. The company further solidified its commitment to quality by establishing the agricultural production corporation "Asahi Noken" in 1990 to conduct experimental cultivation of sake rice, ensuring control over its primary raw material [1].

Today, Asahi-Shuzo continues to operate from its headquarters in Nagaoka City, maintaining its core philosophy of "Quality First" and focusing on the three cornerstones of its brewing: rice, water, and staff [3]. The brewery remains a pillar of the Niigata sake tradition, balancing ancient wisdom with continuous innovation through its Sake Research Center. Its flagship *Kubota* brand, particularly the *Kubota Manju* Junmai Daiginjo, is internationally recognized, symbolizing the brewery's dedication to producing world-class sake that evolves with the times [5].

## Asamai Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1917  
**Founder:** Soko Kakizaki, who founded the brewery with a local friend after noticing the lack of a sake brewery in the ideal brewing location of Hiraka.  
**Location:** Yokote City, Akita Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Exclusive brewing of Junmai-shu since 2011, use of ultra-soft water (2.7 mg/L hardness) from Biwanuma Kansen, and traditional Fune-shibori (box-pressing) filtration.  

### History

Asamai Brewing Company, known for its signature brand Amanoto ("Heaven's Door"), was established in 1917 in the town of Asamai, Hirakamachi, which is now part of Yokote City in Akita Prefecture. The founder, Soko Kakizaki, recognized that the Yokote basin was an ideal location for sake brewing, blessed with vast rice fields and abundant pure water, yet lacked a local brewery. He rallied local support and started the company with a modest capital of 20,000 yen. The name "Amanoto" was inspired by a classical Japanese poem (waka) that references the ancient myth of the sun goddess Amaterasu, symbolizing the hope for a bright future and the inheritance of tradition.

The brewery quickly established a reputation for quality, earning a special prize at a national sake fair and a prize of excellence for four consecutive years starting in 1934. A significant challenge arose in 1943 when the company was forced to close during the wartime period. However, the strong local desire to preserve the Amanoto brand reached the Ministry of Finance, resulting in a new sake brewing license being issued, allowing the brewery to resume operations on December 6, 1944, a testament to its cultural significance within the community.

In the post-war era, Asamai Shuzo continued to innovate while honoring tradition. In 1968, it became one of the first breweries in Akita Prefecture to begin producing and selling special-class Junmai sake. This commitment culminated in 2011 when the brewery made the pioneering decision to brew Junmai-shu exclusively, completely abandoning the use of brewer's alcohol in the fermentation process. This move, a first for Akita, reflects their core philosophy that "Sake is produced from the rice paddies," emphasizing a deep connection to local, sustainably farmed rice and the pure spring water of the Biwanuma Kansen.

Today, Asamai Brewing Company is recognized as a representative brewery of Akita, upholding a tradition of craftsmanship through methods like the slow, traditional Fune-shibori (box-pressing) filtration. Their dedication to quality has been recognized internationally, including a Top Prize in the Junmai Daiginjo section at the International Wine Challenge in 2016 and a Platinum Prize at the Kura Master in 2020. The brewery remains committed to delivering a small happiness to its customers by pursuing the path of brewing sake that brings people together with smiles.

## Brooklyn Kura

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 2018  
**Founder:** Brian Polen (former American Express VP) and Brandon Doughan (Master Brewer with a background in biochemistry)  
**Location:** Sunset Park, Brooklyn, New York  
**Specialty:** American Craft Sake, blending traditional Japanese methods (like Yamahai) with American craft brew creativity, using American rice and Brooklyn water.  

### History

Brooklyn Kura was co-founded by Brian Polen and Brandon Doughan, two American entrepreneurs whose shared passion for sake was ignited after meeting in Japan for a wedding. The company was formally established in 2016, with Polen leaving a nearly decade-long career as a Vice President of marketing at American Express and Doughan leveraging his background in biochemistry to become the Master Brewer [10] [11]. Their vision was to demystify sake and introduce a new tradition of "American Craft Sake" to the Western market, building on over a thousand years of Japanese brewing history [3]. After a period of incubation and home brewing, the physical brewery and taproom officially opened its doors in Industry City, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, in early 2018, marking a significant milestone as the first sake brewery in New York City [8] [12] [13].

The brewery's philosophy centers on using high-quality, locally-sourced ingredients to create a distinctly American product. Their sake is brewed using American rice, koji, Brooklyn water, and yeast, blending traditional Japanese methods with the creativity of the American craft beverage movement [5] [15]. They specialize in subtle and complex sakes, generally best served chilled or at room temperature, actively working to change the common American perception of sake as a hot, distilled spirit [3]. The brewery has gained recognition for its innovative approach, including its take on the traditional Yamahai brewing method, which allows the sake to naturally develop its own lactic acid [14].

As a pioneer in the American sake scene, Brooklyn Kura has continued to expand its influence and operations. In 2021, the brewery entered into a long-term partnership with Hakkaisan Brewery, one of Japan's most respected sake producers, further cementing its commitment to quality and tradition while sharing its passion globally [3]. This growth culminated in 2023 with the opening of a new, expanded Brewery & Tap Room within Industry City, offering an inventive menu, shochu cocktails, and sake on tap, establishing the location as a key gathering place for sake enthusiasts and newcomers alike [3]. Through its dedication to craft and accessibility, Brooklyn Kura has successfully positioned itself at the forefront of the American sake revolution.

## Chiyomusubi Sake Brewery Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1865 (Keiō 1, Edo Period)  
**Founder:** Okasora family founder; the third-generation brewer, Rintarō Okasora, was a key figure who studied at the Ministry of Finance’s Brewing Research Institute  
**Location:** Sakaiminato City, Tottori Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Revival of the local Goriki sake rice; use of traditional futa-koji method; adoption of advanced Joule heating for pasteurization; and expansion into the fermentation industry with products like Koji Amazake.  

### History

Chiyomusubi Sake Brewery was established in 1865 (Keiō 1) during the Edo period in Agarimichi town, Sakaiminato City, Tottori Prefecture, a region historically significant as a thriving port [1] [2]. The brewery's name, "Chiyomusubi," reflects the heartfelt wish to create "eternal happiness and lasting bonds" through sake [1]. The founding family, the Okasora family, began with the philosophy that sake brewing could serve the community, particularly the local farmers and people [4]. The brewery's early history involved two relocations, moving to Naka-machi during the Taishō era and finally to its current location in Taishō-machi in the early Shōwa period [3].

A major milestone occurred during the Taishō era when the third-generation brewer, Rintarō Okasora, significantly advanced the brewery's technical capabilities. He pursued advanced brewing studies at the Ministry of Finance’s Brewing Research Institute, a prestigious institution, and subsequently developed acclaimed, full-bodied sake brands such as *Yamato-damashii* and *Okamasamune* [1]. This period cemented the brewery's reputation for quality. However, the brewery faced a devastating setback in 1945 when its entire building was destroyed by the *Tamaei-maru* explosion accident. The Okasora family immediately began the process of reconstruction, demonstrating their deep commitment to the craft and the community [3]. The company was formally incorporated in 1954 [3].

In the modern era, Chiyomusubi has become a pioneer in reviving the local Tottori sake rice variety, **Goriki**, which had been nearly lost [4]. This commitment to local ingredients is a cornerstone of their brewing philosophy, with a focus on using Tottori-grown rice and pristine water from a natural spring at the foot of the Chūgoku Mountains [1]. The brewery has also embraced innovation, notably adopting the advanced **Joule heating** sterilization method in 2020. This technique allows them to produce pasteurized sake that retains the fresh, lively character typically associated with unpasteurized *namazake* [1] [3].

The brewery's cultural significance extends beyond sake, as it has actively diversified its fermentation expertise. It has expanded its product line to include shochu, gin, and whisky, and has developed health-oriented fermented foods like *Koji Amazake* [1] [3]. This evolution positions Chiyomusubi as a heritage brand transforming into a leader in the broader fermentation industry [1]. The brewery has also expanded its global reach, beginning exports in 1995 and establishing a subsidiary in South Korea in 2009 [3]. The current head of the family, Satoshi Okasora, is the 6th-generation president, continuing the legacy of innovation and tradition as the company looks toward its 200th anniversary [3].

## DASSAI Inc.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** January 23rd, 1948  
**Founder:** Hiroji Sakurai, who revived the family's sake brewery under the name Asahi Shuzo after returning from the war in 1948.  
**Location:** Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Exclusive production of Junmai Daiginjo sake, including the famous Dassai 23, which is polished to 23% of its original size.  

### History

The history of DASSAI Inc. is rooted in a sake brewery originally established in the 1700s in the mountains of Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture [3]. The Sakurai family took over the business in the late 1800s [3]. The modern corporate entity, however, was formally established on January 23, 1948, under the name Asahi Shuzo Co., Ltd. [1] [2]. This re-establishment was led by Hiroji Sakurai, who revived the family's brewing operations after returning from the Second World War [4]. For decades, Asahi Shuzo operated as a small, local producer of low-grade sake, struggling to compete in the regional market.

A radical transformation began in 1984 when Hiroshi Sakurai, the third-generation CEO, took over the struggling company at the age of 34 [5]. Facing a declining local market and internal resistance, he made the bold and controversial decision to cease production of all low-grade sake and focus exclusively on high-quality Junmai Daiginjo [8]. This move was considered revolutionary at the time, as it went against the traditional model of breweries producing a wide range of products. He launched the "Dassai" brand, named after a local term meaning "otter festival," which was used long ago in the region due to otters laying out fish on the shore [3].

The brand's success was driven by an unwavering commitment to quality and innovation, most notably through the introduction of Dassai 23, a sake polished to an unprecedented 23% of its original rice grain size [6]. This pursuit of the highest quality Junmai Daiginjo, combined with a focus on year-round brewing (shiki-jozo) and modern technology, propelled Dassai to become the top-selling premium sake brand in Japan [3]. The company's global expansion included the opening of the Dassai Blue brewery in Hyde Park, New York, in 2023, marking a significant step in bringing premium sake production to the international stage [3].

In a move to align the corporate identity with its globally recognized flagship product, Asahi Shuzo Co., Ltd. officially changed its name to DASSAI Inc. on June 1, 2025 [1]. The company continues to be led by the Sakurai family, with Hiroshi Sakurai serving as Chairman and his son, Kazuhiro Sakurai, as CEO [3]. DASSAI Inc. remains a symbol of modern sake brewing, blending traditional craftsmanship with technological innovation to maintain its reputation as a global leader in the Junmai Daiginjo category.

## Daishichi Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1752  
**Founder:** Saburouemon Ohta, son of a former samurai, who established an independent branch family.  
**Location:** Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Strict adherence to the traditional *kimoto* method, which allows for a lush, deep richness in the sake. Also pioneered the in-house "super-flat rice polishing method" and Japan's first anoxic bottling system.  

### History

Daishichi Brewing Company was established in **1752** (Horeki 2) in the castle town of Nihonmatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, at the foot of Mount Adatara. The Ohta family, originally from Ise province, moved to Nihonmatsu in the Kan’ei period (1624-1643) in the retinue of Lord Niwa and became prominent merchants. The founder, **Saburouemon Ohta**, was the son of Saburobe Yoshishige Ohta, and he established an independent branch family to start the brewery. The brewery has been managed by the Ohta family for ten generations, with each head assuming the name Shichiemon. The current brand name, "Daishichi," was adopted by the 8th-generation head, incorporating part of the family head's traditional name.

From its founding, Daishichi has maintained a strict adherence to the **kimoto** method, the most traditional and orthodox way to brew sake, established around 1700. This commitment is a major part of the brewery's historical significance, as they continued to champion the labor-intensive kimoto method even when simpler techniques like *yamahai* and *sokujomoto* became widespread in the early 20th century. The 8th Shichiemon, after experimenting with *sokujomoto*, concluded that only kimoto could achieve his ideal sake quality, making Daishichi a solitary defender of the tradition. This dedication led to a major milestone in 1938 when Daishichi won the highest first prize, Grand Champion, at the prestigious Japan Sake Awards, spreading its fame across the country.

In modern times, Daishichi has continued to innovate while preserving tradition. They developed the in-house **super-flat rice polishing method** and introduced Japan's first anoxic bottling system. The brewery has also made efforts to deepen the tradition by newly casting Japanese iron cauldrons and constructing a dedicated facility for brewing in wooden vats. Their commitment to excellence has been recognized by the Japanese government, with the head of rice polishing, Yoshio Ogata, and the master brewer, Takanobu Sato, both receiving the "Contemporary Master Craftsman" award—a unique achievement for a single sake brewery.

Daishichi's reputation extends globally, with exports to over 20 countries. Their sake has been served at high-profile international events, including the toast at the G8 Toyako Summit and a gala dinner for European royalty, solidifying their high esteem on the world stage. They continue to win awards, such as the Governor’s Award at the “First Fukushima Industrial Awards” (2016) and the Prize of the Minister of Economic Affairs at the “Seventh Monozukuri Japan Awards” (2018), ensuring that Daishichi continues to make sake history as a leader in kimoto brewing.

## Fuji Brewing Company (Eiko)

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1778 (An'ei 7)  
**Founder:** Kamoya Sennosuke Aritsune, the 4th head of the local Kamoya family and a local estate owner (shoya) with a lineage linked to the samurai general Kato Kiyomasa  
**Location:** Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Commitment to quality improvement ("Always, to a more delicious sake") and use of local Yamagata sake rice like Dewa Sansan and Dewa no Sato.  

### History

Fuji Brewing Company, known for its **Eiko Fuji** brand, was founded in **1778** (An'ei 7) in the Oyama district of Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture [1] [2]. The brewery's founder was **Kamoya Sennosuke Aritsune**, the fourth head of the local Kamoya family, who were prosperous estate owners (shoya) [3] [4]. At its inception, Kamoya Sennosuke established the sake brand simply as "Fuji" (冨士) [5]. The family's lineage is also historically linked to the famous Sengoku period samurai general, **Kato Kiyomasa**, adding a layer of cultural heritage to the brewery's deep roots in the region [4] [6].

The brewery is strategically located on the **Shonai Plain** in Yamagata, a region renowned for its high-quality rice cultivation, which provides the essential raw material for their sake [1]. Yamagata Prefecture itself is a major sake-brewing hub, particularly famous for its **ginjo-style sake** [1]. The brewery's commitment to its local environment is evident in its use of locally grown sake rice, such as **Dewa Sansan** and **Dewa no Sato** [7]. The name "Eiko Fuji," meaning "Glorious Mount Fuji," was adopted in the early Showa 30s (around 1955-1964) when the word "Eiko" (Glorious) was added to the original "Fuji" brand, reflecting the brewery's aspiration for excellence [5] [8].

Today, the brewery is managed by the 13th generation of the Kato family, **Ariyoshi Kato** [1]. After a career in finance in Tokyo, Kato-san returned to his family's business, bringing a new vision for innovation and growth [1]. Under his leadership, the brewery has undergone significant renovation and has attracted new talent, while still maintaining its core philosophy: "Always, to a more delicious sake" [2] [8]. This blend of deep tradition and modern innovation has allowed Eiko Fuji to not only thrive in the domestic market but also to expand its reach internationally [9]. The brewery continues to be a key contributor to the distinct, clean, and fruity style of sake for which the Yamagata region is celebrated [1].

## Fukumitsuya

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1625  
**Founder:** Shioya Tasuke, a pawnbroker from Fukumitsu-cho (Toyama Prefecture) who purchased the original brewery in the An'ei era (1772-1781) and established the current lineage.  
**Location:** Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Junmai-Gura (a brewery that makes only Junmai sake, declared in 2001) and a pioneer in long-term aged sake, with brands like Momotose and Mizuho.  

### History

Fukumitsuya's history dates back to the Edo period, with the original brewery established in **1625 (Kan'ei 2)** in Kanazawa, then part of the Kaga Domain. While the name of the original founder is not explicitly recorded, the brewery's modern lineage began in the **An'ei era (1772-1781)** when **Shioya Tasuke**, a pawnbroker from Fukumitsu-cho in Etchu Province (now Toyama Prefecture), purchased the existing sake brewery. This acquisition laid the foundation for the Fukumitsu family's long-standing tradition of sake brewing in the Ishibiki district of Kanazawa City.

The brewery's current name, Fukumitsuya, was formally adopted in **1803 (Kyowa 3)** by the seventh-generation head of the family, also named Tasuke. He chose the name "Fukumitsuya" in honor of his predecessor's hometown, Fukumitsu-cho. The brewery has remained in its original location for centuries, benefiting from the region's rich culture and the pure, soft groundwater of the Hakusan mountain range, known as *Hyakunensui* (one-hundred-year-old water), which is essential for their brewing process.

A major turning point came in the post-war era under the leadership of the 12th owner, **Hiromu Fukumitsu**. Inspired by European wine culture, he pioneered the concept of long-term aged sake in Japan. Starting his research in **1959**, he explored how different rice types and fermentation processes affected aging. This groundbreaking work led to the launch of "3-Year Aged Fukumasamune Old" in **1969**, and later the establishment of distinct aging processes—*Nojuku* (room temperature) and *Tanjuku* (low temperature)—which resulted in the launch of premium aged sake brands like "Momotose" and "Mizuho" in **1994**.

The brewery cemented its commitment to quality and tradition in **2001** by declaring itself a **Junmai-Gura (純米蔵)**, becoming the first major brewer in Japan to produce only Junmai sake—sake made solely from rice, water, and *koji*, without added alcohol or sugar. This bold move underscored their philosophy of respecting nature and traditional craftsmanship. Fukumitsuya also actively collaborates with local farmers to ensure a stable supply of premium sake rice, such as Yamada Nishiki and Gohyakumangoku, under strict quality control.

Today, Fukumitsuya is recognized as the sake brewery with the longest history in Kanazawa, blending its 400-year heritage with continuous innovation. The brewery maintains a strong cultural presence in Kanazawa and has expanded its product line to include non-sake products like rice milk and cosmetics, all based on the natural fermentation and pure ingredients central to their sake-making expertise. This evolution ensures the brewery remains a forward-thinking leader while honoring its deep roots in Japanese brewing tradition.

## Hachinohe Shuzo Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1775  
**Founder:** Komai Shozaburo, a merchant from Omi Province (present-day Shiga Prefecture)  
**Location:** Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture  
**Specialty:** The brewery's specialty is the "Mutsu Hassen" brand, known for its elegant, fragrant, and clean Nanbu style. They emphasize environmentally-friendly brewing using exclusively Aomori-grown rice, local yeast strains, and spring water from the Kanisawa district. They also utilize unique methods like white koji and a special high-temperature saccharification method ("ko-ontoka") for yeast starter batches[3].  

### History

The history of Hachinohe Shuzo Co., Ltd. is rooted in the ambition of its founder, Komai Shozaburo, who in the Genbun era (1736–1741) left his home in Omi Province (now Shiga Prefecture) to seek the ideal location for sake brewing in the northern land of Mutsu (Tohoku region)[1] [2]. This quest culminated in the official establishment of the brewery in An'ei 4 (1775) in what is now Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture[3]. The brewery has been continuously operated by the Komai family for eight generations, maintaining a deep connection to the local community and its resources[4].

A significant period in the brewery's history was the Taisho era (1912–1926), during which six of its main buildings were constructed. These structures, which include a brick warehouse, an earthen storehouse, and the wooden main building, are notable for their blend of Eastern and Western architectural styles and have been designated as Registered Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan, underscoring the brewery's cultural and historical significance[5] [6]. The brewery's commitment to local sourcing is a core part of its identity, utilizing Aomori-grown rice, local yeast strains, and clear spring water from the Kanisawa district of Hachinohe[3].

In the modern era, Hachinohe Shuzo has embraced innovation while honoring its traditions. A major milestone was the creation of its flagship brand, "Mutsu Hassen," in 1998, named after the legend of the Eight Drunken Immortals of Tohoku[7]. This brand is known for its elegant, fragrant, and clean style, which contrasts with the brewery's other traditional brand, "Mutsu Otokoyama"[3]. The brewery's dedication to quality and innovation has earned it international recognition, including being ranked first among 643 breweries in the global sake brewery rankings in 2021[3]. The current representative is Shozaburo Komai, the eighth generation of the founding family[4].

## Hakkaisan Brewery Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1922  
**Founder:** Koichi Nagumo, a prominent figure in Jonouchi Village, Uonuma, who founded the company with the goal of creating a high-quality, easy-to-drink sake.  
**Location:** Minamiuonuma City, Niigata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on high-quality sake with a smooth, refreshing flavor for meals; utilizes handmade koji, slow, low-temperature fermentation, and pure water from Mt. Hakkaisan. Pioneered the use of underground storage tanks and produces unique snow-aged sake (*Yukimuro-chozo*) and sparkling sake (*Awa Hakkaisan*).  

### History

Hakkaisan Brewery Company was founded in 1922 (Taisho 11) by Koichi Nagumo in Minamiuonuma City, Niigata Prefecture [1] [2]. Nagumo, a prominent local figure, established the brewery on the grounds of a former castle with a singular vision: to produce a pure, delicious sake that was easy to drink and intended for consumption during meals [3]. This foundational philosophy of crafting a well-balanced, smooth, and refreshing sake, rather than a highly aromatic or overly sweet one, has guided the brewery's production methods for over a century [1]. The brewery is deeply rooted in the culture of Uonuma, utilizing the region's abundant natural blessings, most notably the pure groundwater sourced from Mount Hakkaisan's Raidensama no Shimizu Spring [1] [4].

A major turning point occurred in 1953 when Koichi Nagumo passed away, and his twenty-five-year-old son, Kazuo Nagumo, took over as the second president [1]. Kazuo, along with a young team that included the future *toji* (head brewer) Haruo Takahama, laid the groundwork for the modern Hakkaisan Brewery, formalizing the commitment to quality and the meal-friendly style of sake [1]. This dedication to excellence led to several pioneering milestones in the following decades. In 1983, Hakkaisan completed Japan's first underground storage tank for sake, followed by a new underground storage facility in 1989, which enabled long-term, low-temperature product storage—a critical factor in improving and maintaining consistent product quality [1].

The pursuit of quality continued into the 1990s and 2000s with significant investments in infrastructure and technique. In 1992, the brewery completed its in-house rice polishing facility to ensure the highest quality of rice for brewing [1]. This was followed in 2001 by the completion of a dedicated 4.2-kilometer pipeline to collect the pristine groundwater from the Raidensama no Shimizu Spring, securing their most vital ingredient [1]. The brewery also expanded its product line, starting craft beer production in 1998 and releasing shochu and *amazake* (sweet drink made from *koji*) in the late 2000s [1].

In the 21st century, Hakkaisan has embraced its unique regional resources to create signature products. A notable specialty is the *Junmai-ginjo Hakkaisan Yukimuro-chozo Sannen*, a sake aged for three years in a *yukimuro* (snow storage room), which harnesses the natural cooling power of the region's heavy snowfall to maintain a stable, low temperature for aging [1]. The brewery celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2022, continuing its tradition of innovation by establishing Hakkaisan Brewery USA and collaborating with Brooklyn Kura to popularize sake globally [1]. Now led by third-generation president Jiro Nagumo, Hakkaisan remains a global standard-bearer for high-quality, traditional Japanese sake [1].

## Hakutsuru Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1743  
**Founder:** Jihei Kano, a lumber dealer  
**Location:** Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Use of Miyamizu (underground spring water from Rokko Mountains) which is rich in minerals that aid yeast activation, and the development of their own sake rice, Hakutsuru Nishiki.  

### History

Hakutsuru Brewing Company was founded in 1743 in the Nada region of Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, by Jihei Kano, a local lumber dealer. The name "Hakutsuru," meaning "White Crane," was officially adopted in 1747, inspired by the bird's image of purity and longevity. The brewery quickly established a reputation for quality, benefiting from the region's ideal brewing conditions, including the famous Miyamizu water and the cold "Rokko oroshi" wind blowing from Mount Rokko. This foundation in a prime sake-producing area set the stage for the company's long-term success and growth.

The brewery demonstrated early innovation and a commitment to modernization. In 1878, Hakutsuru was one of the first to sell its sake in glass bottles, a significant step in preserving quality and expanding distribution. This was followed by international recognition when the sake was exhibited at the World’s Fair in Paris in 1900. However, the company faced immense challenges, including the near-total destruction of its brew houses during World War II in 1945. Showing remarkable resilience, Hakutsuru rebuilt, notably completing the No.2 brew house in 1952, which was the first earthquake-resistant brewery building in Japan constructed from ferrocement.

The spirit of resilience was tested again by the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, which damaged many of the older wooden structures. In the wake of this disaster, Hakutsuru continued to focus on innovation. Between 1995 and 2007, the company successfully cross-bred and registered its own unique sake rice variety, **Hakutsuru Nishiki**, a cousin of the highly prized Yamada-Nishiki. Today, Hakutsuru Brewing Company stands as one of Japan's largest and most respected sake producers, successfully exporting its extensive product range to over 55 countries and regions worldwide.

The company maintains a balance between time-honored techniques and modern precision. While employing advanced technology like the yabuta press for separating sake from mash, they still use traditional methods, such as hand-washing rice, for their premium Dai Ginjo sakes. This dedication to both heritage and progress ensures their position as a global leader in the sake industry.

## Higashiyama Sake Brewery LLC

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1945  
**Founder:** Unknown  
**Location:** Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on Junmai sake using the famous Fushimizu water and the traditional techniques of the Nanbu Toji master brewers. Known for gently filtered sake that retains a light golden color and original flavor.  

### History

Higashiyama Sake Brewery LLC traces its roots back to an older, generational sake brewery that operated in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto, for many years. The current corporate entity was formally established in 1945 (Showa 20) through a reorganization. This marked a new chapter for the brewery, which, despite the formal re-establishment date, carries the legacy and traditional knowledge of its long-standing predecessor. The brewery's history is characterized by a commitment to preserving the techniques of its past while adapting to the modern sake industry [1] [2].

Following its reorganization, the brewery relocated several times before finally settling in its current, permanent location in the famous sake-brewing district of Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City, in 1984. A significant milestone in the brewery's modern history was the establishment of a partnership with the major Fushimi brewer, Kizakura Sake Brewery, beginning in 1967. This collaboration has been instrumental in the brewery's continued operation and success in the competitive Fushimi region [2].

Higashiyama Shuzo is deeply committed to traditional brewing methods, notably utilizing the highly-regarded Fushimizu spring water, which is known for its medium-hard mineral content that aids in fermentation. The brewery is also a rare example in Fushimi of having inherited the techniques and experience of the Nanbu Toji (master brewers) from Iwate Prefecture, with its current master brewer, Mr. Yasuo Hosaka, possessing over 40 years of experience. This dedication to craft has led to the brewery being highly regarded within the Kizakura Group as a "masterpiece of art" [1] [2].

The brewery's flagship brand, Konteki (坤滴), meaning "drops from the earth," is a Junmai sake that has achieved notable success, including a gold medal at the National New Sake Tasting Competition and an excellence award at the Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau Sake Tasting Competition. Another notable brand, Rosanjin, is made using 100% of the rare local Kyoto sake rice "Iwai," further demonstrating the brewery's focus on regional ingredients and unique flavor profiles [1].

## Homare Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1918  
**Founder:** Kosaku Karahashi, who ran a miso and koji manufacturing business from a rice wholesaler.  
**Location:** Kitakata City, Fukushima Prefecture  
**Specialty:** The brewery's specialty is the use of ultra-soft spring water sourced from the Iide Mountains, which is recognized as one of the "100 Famous Waters of the Heisei Era." This water is key to producing sake with a gentle mouthfeel and rich sweetness. The brewery also emphasizes high-level quality control and reproducibility, alongside a diverse product line that includes innovative items like fruit-flavored nigori sake.  

### History

Homare Brewing Company was founded on September 5, 1918, in Kano Village, Fukushima Prefecture, by Kosaku Karahashi. At the age of 29, Karahashi, who had previously operated a miso and koji manufacturing business from a rice wholesaler, established the company as Kano Shuzo Co., Ltd. The company's headquarters and factory were relocated in 1921 to Muramatsu in Matsuyama Village, which is now part of Kitakata City. The name was officially changed to Homare Shuzo Co., Ltd. on August 19, 1949, marking the beginning of the modern company.

The brewery faced a major setback in 1952 when a fire destroyed approximately 80% of the factory. However, through intensive reconstruction efforts, operations were quickly resumed by the end of the year. This resilience was immediately followed by a significant achievement: winning the top prize at the 1st National Sake Appraisal, establishing the brewery's reputation for quality. The subsequent decades saw a period of aggressive expansion, including the absorption of several other breweries and a massive increase in production, with sales volume surpassing 50,000 koku by 1974.

In the mid-1980s, the brewery began to focus on premium production, starting small-batch brewing at the Iide-gura facility in 1985 and launching its first Ginjo-grade sake in 1986. This commitment to quality culminated in major international recognition in the modern era. In 2015, Homare Brewing Company was awarded the prestigious International Wine Challenge (IWC) Champion Sake trophy. The following year, their "Banshu-san Yamada Nishiki Junmai Daiginjo" was selected as a souvenir by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for the G7 Ise-Shima Summit. The company celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2018, continuing its legacy of innovation and excellence in sake brewing.

## Ichinokura Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1973  
**Founder:** Zensaku Matsumoto, first president who led the merger of the four founding breweries (Asami Shoten, Kachiki Shuzoten, Sakurai Shuzoten, and Matsumoto Shuzoten)  
**Location:** Ōsaki City, Miyagi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering the "Mukansa" (un-evaluated) Honjozo to challenge the old tax system, and developing low-alcohol sakes like "Himezen" and sparkling "Suzune." Also notable for its in-house Agriculture Department and commitment to local, handmade brewing.  

### History

Ichinokura Co., Ltd. was founded in **1973** through the merger of four long-established sake breweries in the Matsuyama area of Ōsaki City, Miyagi Prefecture: Asami Shoten, Kachiki Shuzoten, Sakurai Shuzoten, and Matsumoto Shuzoten. This strategic union was a direct response to the post-war trend of mass-produced, low-quality *sanzōshu* sake, which had become popular but was seen as detrimental to the industry's heritage. The merger was spearheaded by **Zensaku Matsumoto**, who became the first president of the newly formed company. The core philosophy was a "return to origins," emphasizing traditional, handmade brewing methods using all five senses, and a "reversal of thinking" to integrate sake production with local agriculture and community revitalization.

A major milestone that cemented Ichinokura's reputation as an innovator was the launch of **"Mukansa" Honjozo** in 1977. The name, meaning "un-evaluated," was a bold statement against the government's tax-based grading system, which categorized sake by quality for taxation purposes. By labeling their high-quality sake as a second-class product, Ichinokura challenged the status quo, asserting that the customer, not the government, should be the ultimate judge of quality. This move was a commercial success and a cultural statement that helped shift the industry's focus back to genuine craftsmanship.

The brewery continued its innovative path in the 1980s by pioneering the development of **low-alcohol sake**, a category that was virtually non-existent at the time. Products like the sweet and fruity "Himezen" and the naturally sparkling "Suzune" were created to appeal to a broader audience and adapt to changing food cultures, proving that tradition and innovation could coexist. Furthermore, recognizing the critical link between rice quality and sake quality, Ichinokura established its own **in-house Agriculture Department in 2004**. This initiative promotes sustainable farming practices and ensures a consistent supply of fine-quality rice, with over 90% of the rice used in their brewing sourced locally from Miyagi Prefecture.

Today, Ichinokura remains one of Miyagi Prefecture's largest and most respected breweries. It maintains its commitment to the Nanbu Toji School's traditional techniques while continuing to develop new products that reflect modern tastes. The brewery's location in the Matsuyama area of Ōsaki City, known for its fine rice and abundant soft underground water, continues to be central to its identity, embodying its founding vision of creating sake in harmony with nature and the local community.

## Imada Sake Brewing Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1868  
**Founder:** Miho Imada's great-grandfather (name unknown), who established the family-run brewery.  
**Location:** Akitsu-cho, Higashi-Hiroshima, Hiroshima Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Ginjo-style sake brewing using the soft water method; revival and use of the heirloom Hattanso sake rice; and innovative use of white koji in some sakes. The brewery is led by Miho Imada, one of Japan's first female Toji (master brewers).  

### History

Imada Sake Brewing Co., Ltd., operating under the brand name Fukucho, was founded in 1868, the first year of Japan's Meiji era, in the town of Akitsu, Hiroshima Prefecture [1] [2]. The brewery was established by the great-grandfather of the current president, Miho Imada, and has remained a family-run business for four generations [3] [4]. The brewery is situated in Mitsu, a port town on the Seto Inland Sea, an area famous for its soft water and as the birthplace of the delicate ginjo-style sake [5] [6]. The brand name "Fukucho" (meaning "Forever Fortune") was bestowed upon the sake in 1910 by Miura Senzaburo, a local brewing legend known as the "father of Hiroshima sake," who also formulated the soft water brewing method that the brewery adopted [1] [7].

The brewery's history is marked by a commitment to the local terroir and the ginjo tradition. A major milestone in its modern history was the revival of the heirloom sake rice strain, Hattanso, which had been absent from Hiroshima's fields for over a century [5]. Beginning in 2001, the brewery undertook a challenging, multi-year project to cultivate the rice from a handful of leftover seeds, a process that has become a signature of their dedication to local ingredients [5]. The company was formally incorporated as Imada Sake Brewing Co., Ltd. in 1950 and began exporting its products internationally in 1997 [1].

The most significant recent development is the leadership of Miho Imada, who returned to the family business in 1994 and became the Toji (master brewer) in 2000, a rare achievement for a woman in the traditionally male-dominated sake industry [1] [8]. Under her guidance, the brewery has gained international acclaim, with their Fukucho Hattanso Junmai Ginjo winning Platinum at the prestigious Kura Master awards in France in both 2017 and 2018 [1]. Imada's influence has brought global recognition to the brewery, culminating in her selection as the sole Japanese person on the BBC 100 Women 2020 list [1].

Today, Imada Shuzo Honten continues to champion the Akitsu ginjo style, focusing on brewing with intense care (ginmi) and using local Hiroshima-grown rice and yeast [5]. The brewery balances tradition with innovation, exemplified by their use of white koji in some of their sakes to achieve unique flavor profiles [5]. The brewery's motto, "A Hundred Tries, a Thousand Improvements," a phrase passed down from Miura Senzaburo, continues to guide their pursuit of ever lighter and more refined sake [5].

## Imanishi Seibee Shoten

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1884  
**Founder:** Imanishi family (The specific name of the first-generation founder is not publicly detailed, but the family established the brewery in 1884)  
**Location:** Nara City, Nara Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Preservation of the historic Nanto Morohaku brewing method, where both the koji-mai and kake-mai are polished. Also known for using a proprietary variation of Kyokai #7 yeast.  

### History

Imanishi Seibee Shoten was established in 1884, during Japan's Meiji period, in the historic Naramachi district of Nara City, Nara Prefecture [1] [2]. Nara is widely recognized as the birthplace of sake brewing in Japan, and the brewery's location is steeped in history, situated near world heritage sites such as Kasuga Taisha Shrine and Todai-ji Temple [1]. The brewery's main brand, "Harushika" (春鹿), which translates to "Spring Deer," is a direct homage to this location, named after the sacred deer of Kasuga Taisha Shrine, which are said to have carried the deities to Nara [1] [2]. The brewery's philosophy is encapsulated in the phrase: "Polish the rice, polish the water, polish the skill and polish the heart" [3].

A major element of the brewery's historical and cultural significance is its dedication to the traditional brewing method known as Nanto Morohaku (南都諸白) [4]. Nanto Morohaku, meaning "both white," is a historical term for high-quality sake developed in Nara (Nanto) where both the *koji-mai* (rice for koji) and *kake-mai* (rice added to the mash) are polished [5]. This technique, which originated in Nara's temples, was a significant advancement in sake production and forms the foundation of modern sake brewing [6]. Imanishi Seibee Shoten continues to uphold this tradition, creating sake that is characterized by a light, mellow taste, a smooth mouthfeel, and a refreshing flavor [1].

The brewery has achieved notable success both domestically and internationally. Its products are exported to over a dozen countries, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom [1]. The current president and fifth-generation successor, Kiyotaka Imanishi, continues to oversee the operation, ensuring the preservation of traditional methods while embracing modern innovation [2]. The brewery's commitment to quality has been recognized with multiple awards, including the prestigious Kura Master Platinum Award in 2024 for several of its Junmai Daiginjo products [1]. The brewery itself, with its traditional architecture, remains a historical landmark in Naramachi, offering tours and tastings to visitors [2].

## Ippongi Kubohonten Co.,Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1902  
**Founder:** Nikichi Kubo, fifth head of the Kubo family, who inherited the historic 'Ippongi' sake brand name.  
**Location:** Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on a "juicy dryness" and a "majesty that fades away like a dream," achieved through the fusion of the Nambu brewing method with the cold, humid Okuechizen climate, and the use of the locally developed Sakahomare sake rice.  

### History

The history of Ippongi Kubohonten is deeply intertwined with the local history of Katsuyama City in Fukui Prefecture, a region known as Okuechizen. The name "Ippongi" itself, which translates to "ultimate truth" from the Zen concept of *Dai Ichi Gitai*, predates the brewery's founding. It was originally bestowed upon the sake brewed for the local feudal lord, the Ogasawara family, who governed Katsuyama for eight generations [1] [5]. The brewery was officially founded in 1902 (Meiji 35) by Nikichi Kubo, the fifth head of the Kubo family, who inherited the historic "Ippongi" brand name from the Kasamatsu family, a prominent local family [1] [2]. Within just two decades of its establishment, the brewery's reputation for its "crisp, dry sake" propelled it to become the largest sake producer in Fukui Prefecture [1] [4].

In the 1960s, Ippongi adopted the Nambu method of brewing, a style known for its clean and light profile, in an effort to further refine its sake. However, the cold and humid climate of Okuechizen presented a challenge, as the Nambu method was developed for cold, dry regions [1]. Over the next six decades, four generations of master brewers diligently adapted the Nambu techniques to their unique local environment, eventually surpassing the classic Nambu profile to create a distinctive combination of transparency and softness [3]. This dedication to the craft has been recognized with significant accolades, including winning first place in the prestigious Nambu-Toji Sake Contest twice, in 2007 and 2016 [3].

A major milestone in the brewery's modern history is its commitment to local terroir through the development of a new sake rice. Recognizing the limitations of non-local rice varieties, Ippongi collaborated with the Fukui Prefectural government to create an original, high-quality sake rice named "Sakahomare." After eight years of research, Sakahomare was launched in 2018 [3]. The brewery quickly demonstrated the rice's potential by winning a Gold prize in the Japan Sake Awards with a sake made from Sakahomare, a rare achievement for a rice other than the "king of sake rice," Yamadanishiki [3].

Today, Ippongi Kubohonten continues to champion its local identity, having rebranded for its 120th anniversary to focus on using only Sakahomare rice grown in the Okuechizen region [1] [3]. The brewery's philosophy centers on creating a "special mouthfeel sensation that fades away like a dream," achieved through meticulous techniques like polishing rice down to 30% and using traditional pressing methods such as *fukurozuri* (gravity drip) and *fune* press [3]. This blend of deep historical roots, continuous innovation, and commitment to the unique climate of Katsuyama ensures Ippongi's position as a distinguished producer of premium sake [1].

## Izumibashi Shuzo Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1857 (Ansei 4, Edo era)  
**Founder:** Yuhachi Hashiba, from a family of rice farmers with over 400 years of history in the region  
**Location:** Ebina City, Kanagawa Prefecture  
**Specialty:** "Saibai Jōzōgura" (Cultivation-Brewery) status, meaning they manage the entire process from growing their own sake rice (using organic/reduced-pesticide methods) to brewing, and exclusively produce Junmai-grade sake (Zenryo Junmai Kura)  

### History

Izumibashi Shuzo Co., Ltd. was founded in 1857, during the late Edo period (Ansei 4), by Yuhachi Hashiba in the Ebina heartland of Kanagawa Prefecture [1] [3]. The Hashiba family had been cultivating rice in the area, a prominent granary known as Ebina Kouchi, for over 400 years prior to establishing the brewery [1]. The brewery was strategically located to leverage the abundant rice from the fertile alluvial plain created by the Sagami River and the mineral-rich underground water from the Tanzawa mountain range [1]. This deep connection to the land and its agricultural heritage formed the foundational philosophy of the company.

A significant milestone in the brewery's history was the formal naming of its flagship brand, "Izumibashi," in 1927 [1]. The name is a combination of "Izumigawa," a local irrigation canal that flowed north of the brewery and served the rice fields, and "Hashiba," the family's name [1]. While the family's agricultural activities were temporarily halted after World War II, the brewery made a decisive return to its roots in 1996 by restarting serious sake rice cultivation [1]. This led to the formation of the "Sagami Sakamai Research Group" with local producers the following year, dedicated to the study and improvement of sake rice farming [1].

The 21st century marked a period of renewed commitment to quality and tradition. In 2006, Izumibashi became a "Zenryo Junmai Kura," meaning they exclusively brew *Junmai* grade sake, which is made only from rice, water, yeast, and *koji*, without added distilled alcohol [2]. This dedication culminated in 2016 with the trademark registration of the term "Saibai Jōzōgura" (Cultivation-Brewery), solidifying their identity as one of the few breweries in Japan that manages the entire process from rice cultivation to brewing [1] [2]. The current president, Yuichi Hashiba, is the sixth-generation owner and also serves as the master brewer [2].

The brewery's commitment to sustainable and integrated production is symbolized by the red dragonfly (*Akatonbo*) on their label [1]. The dragonfly, which flies over their rice fields, represents their promise to use organic and reduced-pesticide farming methods [1]. Today, Izumibashi Shuzo is recognized for its vibrant, umami-rich sake that complements food, and its role in preserving the agricultural and cultural heritage of the Kanagawa region [2].

## Kamenoi Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1875  
**Founder:** Unknown (Imai family), revived by the great-grandfather in 1956  
**Location:** Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on high-quality Ginjo-grade sake, particularly the flagship brand "Kudoki Jozu." Known for rigorous quality control, including the refrigeration of all products until shipment, and the historical use of Yeast No. 10 (Ogawa Yeast) in developing its signature style.  

### History

Kamenoi Brewing Company, known in Japanese as Kamenoi Shuzo (亀の井酒造), was established in 1875 (Meiji 8) in the Shonai region of Yamagata Prefecture. Despite its founding in the Meiji era, the brewery's history is marked by two significant periods of disruption that led to temporary closures. The first closure was caused by a major fire, and the second was due to the government's corporate control policies during World War II. Following the second closure, the family temporarily shifted to farming to sustain themselves.

The brewery was successfully revived in January 1956 (Showa 31) by the great-grandfather of the current head, marking a new chapter for the Imai family's sake-making tradition. In January 1961 (Showa 36), the brewery relocated to its current site in Tsuruoka City, near the sacred mountain of Mt. Hagurosan. This period of rebuilding set the stage for the brewery's modern identity, though the current head notes that the brewery's history is relatively short compared to some of its peers due to the periods of dormancy.

A major turning point came under the leadership of the 4th generation head, Shuji Imai (今井俊治). Determined to create a distinctive sake, he focused on the technically challenging art of *ginjo*-grade brewing. He sought guidance from Chikara Ogawa (小川知可良), the developer of the renowned Yeast No. 10, and adopted a meticulous, quality-focused approach. This dedication culminated in the 1983 (Showa 58) launch of the flagship brand, "Kudoki Jozu" (くどき上手). The brand name, which translates roughly to "good at charming/persuading," was inspired by the mother of the 4th generation head, who wished for the sake to "charm" people in the same way Toyotomi Hideyoshi charmed his way to success.

Today, the brewery is led by the 5th generation, Toshihiko Imai (今井俊典), who continues the tradition of high-quality *ginjo* brewing. The company is known for its rigorous quality control, including the refrigeration of all products until shipment, ensuring the sake reaches consumers in optimal condition. The "Kudoki Jozu" line has expanded to include over 50 varieties, and the brewery remains committed to its mission of delivering Japan's finest sake to the local community and beyond, upholding the legacy of revival and innovation.

## Kamikokoro Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1913  
**Founder:** Chojuro Fujii, established the company in 1913. No further background details found.  
**Location:** Yorishima-cho, Asakuchi-city, Okayama Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Okayama White Peach yeast (kobo) derived from the skin of local white peaches, which imparts a unique fruity aroma and subtly sweet flavor. They also focus on brewing sake that brings out the umami flavor of Okayama Prefecture rice.  

### History

Kamikokoro Brewing Company, known in Japanese as KAMIKOKOROSHUZO CO., LTD., was established in October 1913 by its founder, Chojuro Fujii, in Yorishima-cho, Asakuchi-city, Okayama Prefecture [1] [3]. The brewery is located in the small seaside town of Yorishima on the Seto Inland Sea [3]. Despite being a relatively young brewery in the context of Japan's long sake-making history, Kamikokoro has built a reputation on its unwavering commitment to quality, encapsulated in its founding belief of being a "brewery that sells quality" [1] [4].

The brewery's philosophy centers on providing genuine products that can be consumed with peace of mind, a principle that has guided its operations for over a century [1]. This consistent stance, particularly the focus on pursuing the delicious umami flavor of rice, was maintained even through challenging periods such as the rice shortages following World War Two, suggesting a deep-seated dedication to their craft [4]. A major milestone was reached in 2013 when the company celebrated its 100th anniversary [1].

In the modern era, Kamikokoro has embraced innovation while preserving its core values. The brewery is currently overseen by the fifth-generation brewmaster, Nobuhiko Fujii [1]. They employ modern techniques, such as using the latest rice washing machines and maintaining a strict air conditioning system that keeps the brewery temperature at around 5°C during brewing, which ensures a clean environment and stable fermentation [1] [4]. Furthermore, they utilize bottle storage for many of their brands to maintain optimal condition year-round [1].

The brewery's most notable contribution to the sake world is its development and use of the Okayama White Peach yeast (kobo) [2] [4]. This specialty yeast, developed by the 4th generation brewer, is derived from the skin of Okayama's famous white peaches, a fruit for which the region is well-known [2]. This unique yeast imparts a distinct fruity aroma and a subtly sweet flavor to the sake, differentiating Kamikokoro's products in the market and contributing to their growing international recognition [2]. The company continues to explore new possibilities for the umami flavor of rice as it looks to create another 100 years of history [1].

## Katoukichibee Shouten

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1860  
**Founder:** The sixth-generation head of the Kato family, who was a money-changing merchant and village headman  
**Location:** Sabae City, Fukui Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Long-term, low-temperature maturation (below 0°C) of all Junmai sake, and use of underground water from the Hakusan mountain range.  

### History

Katoukichibee Shouten's roots stretch back over 325 years, long before it became a sake brewery. The Kato family business initially operated as a prominent money-changing merchant and village headman in what is now Sabae City, Fukui Prefecture. The sake brewing operation officially began in 1860 when the sixth-generation head of the family decided to diversify the business, utilizing the rice they received from local farmers. The inherited name "Kichibee" has been passed down through the generations, and the name was formally registered as a trademark in 1866.

The brewery quickly established a reputation for quality, which was cemented in the early 20th century. A major milestone was achieved in 1928 when the brewery's sake was selected to be served at the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Showa, a profound honor that brought national recognition. This event marked the beginning of the brewery's commitment to producing sake of the highest caliber. The brewery's main brand, "BORN" (梵), was named after the Sanskrit word for "purity" or "truth," reflecting the brewery's philosophy.

Katoukichibee Shouten is renowned for its dedication to the Junmai style (pure rice sake) and its unique brewing specialty: long-term, low-temperature maturation. All of their sake is matured at below 0 degrees Celsius for at least one year, and some premium varieties are aged for up to 10 years or more, a process that develops a rich and extremely flavorful profile. The brewery uses carefully selected rice, including Yamada Nishiki and local Fukui rice, and pure natural water drawn from a 180-meter deep well, which originates in the Hakusan mountain range.

Under the leadership of the 11th-generation president, Atsuhide Kato, the brewery has become a global success. In 1998, their BORN: ICE BERG received the Grand Prix award at the International Sake Festival in Toronto. The brewery's products have since received numerous international accolades and are famously used for official toasts at state dinners and international events hosted by the Japanese government, solidifying its status as a representative of Japan's finest sake.

## Katsuyama Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1688  
**Founder:** The Isawa family, whose lineage began with Isawa Iekage, a retainer of the Kamakura Shogunate. The family transitioned from samurai to gentry before founding the brewery.  
**Location:** Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** "Samurai Style" sake, a commitment to world-class quality Junmai Daiginjo and Junmai Ginjo expressions designed to pair with diverse international cuisine. They were the official brewery for the Daté Clan.  

### History

Katsuyama Brewing Company, also known as Katsuyama Shuzo, traces its origins to the Isawa family, whose lineage began with Isawa Iekage, a retainer of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1190. The family transitioned from their samurai roots to become prominent landed gentry and merchants in the castle town of Sendai. In 1688, during the Genroku era, the Isawa family began brewing sake, marking the official founding of the brewery. The name "Katsuyama" was bestowed upon the sake after Iekage's younger brother, Iehisa, a legendary warrior, using his Buddhist posthumous name, signifying "A Triumph as Vast as the Mountain" and carrying profound auspicious significance for the samurai class [1] [2].

The brewery quickly rose to prominence and was appointed as the official brewery (*Goshu Goyōgura*) to serve the powerful Daté Clan of the Sendai Domain, which was founded by the charismatic samurai Lord Masamune Daté. This appointment cemented Katsuyama's status as a producer of top-class sake, intended exclusively for the feudal lord and his guests. The brewery's history is inextricably linked to the refined culinary and sake culture of the Daté Clan, where sake was considered a form of social and diplomatic art, shared only among those of character and culture to elevate humanity and spirit [1] [3].

Today, Katsuyama remains the only surviving official brewery of the Daté Clan of Sendai Domain, continuing a tradition that spans over 330 years. While honoring its timeless essence, the brewery has evolved its expression for the modern era, adopting a philosophy they term "Samurai Style" sake. This approach is characterized by an unwavering commitment to world-class quality, focusing on crafting sake that resonates with today's diverse culinary cultures rather than traditional regional pairings [4].

This commitment to excellence has earned Katsuyama significant international recognition. Their products, particularly the Junmai Daiginjo and Junmai Ginjo expressions, have received numerous accolades, including the prestigious International Wine Challenge (IWC) Champion Sake award for their "Ken" Junmai Ginjo, solidifying their reputation as a global leader in the premium sake market [5].

## Kenbishi Sake Brewing Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** Before 1505  
**Founder:** Unknown  
**Location:** Higashinada-ku, Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Traditional brewing methods utilizing extensive wooden equipment, including rice steamers, *koji* rooms, and *dakidaru* barrels for temperature control, to produce a bold, rich sake with nutty umami. The brewery also maintains its own wood workshop to craft and preserve these traditional tools, ensuring the continuity of its unique style.  

### History

Kenbishi Sake Brewing Co., Ltd. is one of Japan's oldest sake brands, with its founding dating to before 1505, placing its origins in the turbulent Warring States period (Sengoku period) [1] [2]. The brewery was originally established in Itami, Hyogo Prefecture, a region historically significant for sake production. A major milestone in its early history was the creation of its iconic diamond logo, which is recognized as the first trademark in the history of sake in Japan, a symbol that has remained unchanged for over 500 years [1] [2]. This early branding and the quality of its product led to its widespread popularity, particularly among the samurai class and shoguns during the Edo period (1603-1868) [1].

The brewery's cultural significance is profound, having been woven into the fabric of Japanese popular culture. Kenbishi sake is famously featured in the classic kabuki play *Chushingura*, and its unmistakable diamond logo can be seen in the first print of Utagawa Hiroshige's iconic series illustrating life along the great Tokaido road [2]. Over the centuries, the company passed through several families, with the Shirakishi family taking over the management in 1928 [2]. This transition marked the beginning of a new era of resilience, as the brewery faced a series of devastating natural and man-made disasters in the 20th century.

Kenbishi's history is a testament to its enduring spirit, having survived the Great Hanshin Flood of 1938 and being completely destroyed by firebombing raids during World War II in 1945 [2]. The brewery rebuilt each time, only to face another catastrophic event in the Great Kobe Earthquake of 1995, which destroyed seven of its eight brewery buildings [2]. Despite these setbacks, the brewery, now located in Higashinada-ku, Kobe, continues to operate under the leadership of the Shirakishi family, with Masataka Shirakishi taking over as president in 2017 [1] [2]. The company's guiding philosophy, "Be the stopped clock," reflects its commitment to preserving its traditional taste and methods while innovating to ensure its survival for the next 500 years [1].

## Kikumasamune Sake Brewing Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1659  
**Founder:** Jirotayu Munenori Kano (Hon Kano family), who began large-scale brewing operations in 1659.  
**Location:** Mikage, Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Single-minded pursuit of dry sake (*karakuchi*) using the traditional *Kimoto* method, which was adopted for its entire Honjozo series in 2009.  

### History

Kikumasamune Sake Brewing Co., Ltd. was founded in 1659 by Jirotayu Munenori Kano of the Kano family in Mikage, Kobe, which is part of the famed Nada region in Hyogo Prefecture [1] [2]. The Kano family established a large-scale brewing operation during the Edo period, a time when Japan was under the rule of the fourth Tokugawa shogun, Ietsuna. The sake produced here, known as *kudarizake* (sake traveling down from the Kansai region to Edo), quickly gained a strong reputation and popularity in Edo (present-day Tokyo), playing a key role in establishing the Nada region as a premier sake-producing area. The Kano family's deep connection to sake is underscored by a legend that an ancestor received the family surname from Emperor Go-Daigo after presenting him with sake brewed from the water of Mikagezawa [1].

The brewery underwent significant modernization and expansion under the leadership of the eighth head of the family, Jiroemon Kano (Shukoo), during the Meiji period. Jiroemon Kano pioneered industry-leading technological improvements, registered the Kiku-Masamune brand as a trademark, and even founded the private Nada Junior and Senior High School in 1927 [1]. This era marked a period of rapid growth, with the company expanding its reach through overseas exports and earning the distinction of becoming a purveyor to the Imperial Household Agency. The company's success peaked in the early Showa period, achieving the industry's highest production volume in 1938. Even through the hardships of the Showa era, Kikumasamune maintained its quality, a fact confirmed by a 1949 public opinion survey in which the brand ranked highest in overall quality and popularity among sake professionals [1].

In the post-war era, the company continued to achieve notable milestones, including a visit from Emperor Showa in 1947 and the completion of the four-season Kikueigura Plant in 1965. The company's dedication to its traditional craft was formally recognized in 1971 when its brewing system was designated an Important Folk Cultural Property by the Japanese government. Kikumasamune also demonstrated a pioneering spirit in international business, becoming the first company in the industry to be recognized for its contributions to Japanese exports in 1970. Despite the tragic destruction of its Sake Brewing Museum in the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, the company rebuilt and continues to operate, celebrating its 350th anniversary in 2009 and remaining a globally recognized name in the sake industry [1].

## Kikunosato Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1866  
**Founder:** Akutsu Tōemon, first-generation master brewer who established the brewery under the trade name Hōryūsha (蜂竜舎) by digging a well for high-quality water in Otawara City.  
**Location:** Otawara City, Tochigi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on the abundant underground water of Nasunogahara and the success of the 'Daina' brand, which led to a revival of the brewery. The brewery also emphasizes collaborations, including those with popular manga and celebrities.  

### History

Kikunosato Brewing Company was established on October 1, 1866 (Keiō 2), in Otawara City, Tochigi Prefecture, an area known as Nasunogahara, which is rich in historical heritage and agricultural land. The founder, the first-generation master brewer Akutsu Tōemon, established the brewery under the original trade name Hōryūsha (蜂竜舎) after seeking out and securing a source of high-quality water in the region. The brewery benefited from the natural bounty of Nasunogahara, which is blessed with abundant underground water and the clear Naka River, and has been a center for rice cultivation since ancient times. The brewery produced popular brands such as "Ichiryu" and "Kimi no Tomo" in its early years.

The brewery's operations were interrupted in 1942 (Shōwa 17) due to the government's Enterprise Adjustment Order. It was revived in 1955 and re-established as a corporation, Kikunosato Shuzo Co., Ltd., the following year. The new name, Kikunosato (Chrysanthemum Village), was chosen because the surrounding area was historically a center for growing edible chrysanthemums. Under the third-generation master brewer, Akutsu Kanzō, the brewery reached a peak production of approximately 2,000 koku in the Shōwa 50s (1975-1984). However, the company faced severe hardship after 1985 when a major contract with a large brewery was terminated, leading to a sharp decline in production, which bottomed out at around 100 koku in 2002, making it the smallest producer in Tochigi Prefecture.

The brewery's fortunes were reversed under the leadership of the current (eighth-generation) master brewer, Akutsu Shin. He spearheaded a revival by launching the new flagship brand "Daina" (大那), which was trademarked in 2004. After a slow start, full-scale production began in 2006. A turning point came in 2009 when the brand was featured in the magazine "danchu," which significantly boosted its recognition and sales. This success, coupled with the rising popularity of sake, led to the brewery winning its first Gold Prize at the National New Sake Appraisal in 2010. By 2016, production had increased to 600 koku, and the brewery began exporting to Asia, Europe, and North America. Continuing its commitment to innovation, Kikunosato launched the premium brand "Aratana" (新たな) in 2023, solidifying its status as a globally recognized producer.

## Kikusui Sake Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1881 (Meiji 14)  
**Founder:** Setsugoro Takasawa, who left his family home at the age of 16 to start his own business. The Takasawa family were a branch family, not local landlords.  
**Location:** Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering the *Nama-Sake* (unpasteurized sake) boom with the introduction of "Funaguchi Kikusui Ichiban Shibori" in 1972, which was Japan's first commercially available *Nama-Sake*. The product is sold in a can to protect the delicate unpasteurized sake from light.  

### History

Kikusui Sake Co., Ltd. was founded in 1881 (Meiji 14) in Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture, a region renowned as Japan's number one rice production area. Unlike many traditional breweries started by local landlords, the founder, Setsugoro Takasawa, came from a branch family and did not possess the same privileges. Setsugoro left his family home at the age of 16 to establish the brewery, embodying a spirit of entrepreneurship and commitment to making high-quality sake accessible to more people. The name "Kikusui" is derived from a classical Noh play, "Kikujido," symbolizing eternal youth and was registered as a trademark in 1910.

The brewery has faced significant adversity throughout its history. In the post-war years, it struggled with securing rice, labor shortages, and drops in sales. The most severe challenges came in the mid-1960s when the brewery was destroyed and washed away in two consecutive years by the Niigata Earthquake in 1964 and the Kaetsu Flood in 1966 and 1967. Despite these setbacks, Kikusui remained committed to its vision. This resilience led to a major innovation in 1972 with the introduction of "Funaguchi Kikusui Ichiban Shibori," Japan's first commercially available *Nama-Sake* (unpasteurized sake), which pioneered the *Nama-Sake* boom and is now a signature product.

In 2006, Kikusui established the Kikusui Sake Culture Institute to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the company's incorporation. This institute is dedicated to the research, development, and production of sake, as well as promoting the history, traditions, and culture of Japanese sake to the modern age. The company continues to receive recognition for its quality, having been awarded numerous Gold Prizes in authoritative competitions like the Annual Japan Sake Awards and a Gold Medal at the International Wine Challenge (IWC) in 2014 for its *Funaguchi* and *Kuramitsu* products.

Today, Kikusui is run by the 5th generation of the Takasawa family, with Daisuke Takasawa serving as President. The brewery operates with a philosophy of cultivating the blessings of the earth and the power of fermentation to create spiritually enriching lifestyles. By combining traditional brewing methods with modern technology and innovative products like *Funaguchi*, Kikusui has successfully evolved with changing drinking preferences while remaining a key contributor to Niigata's rich sake culture.

## Kita Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1820  
**Founder:** Ginzaemon Kita, a merchant who procured local Ohmi-brand rice to establish the brewery on the Koto plain in Ohmi.  
**Location:** Higashiomi City, Shiga Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing with natural spring water from the Suzuka Mountains and locally grown Ohmi rice. The current Toji, Mayuko Kita, employs the Noto Toji Guild's style, focusing on quality koji and slow, gradual fermentation to achieve a *taoyaka* (graceful and supple) sake.  

### History

Kita Brewing Company (Kita Shuzo) was established in 1820, during Japan's Bunsei era, by its founder, Ginzaemon Kita. The brewery is strategically located in Higashiomi City, Shiga Prefecture, on the Koto plain, a region historically known as Ohmi. Ginzaemon Kita, a merchant, leveraged the local resources by procuring high-quality Ohmi-brand rice from nearby farmers and utilizing the exceptionally soft and clean underground water. This water originates from the snowmelt of the Suzuka Mountains, which is naturally filtered through the land before becoming the well water that feeds the brewery. This foundation of superior local ingredients set the stage for the brewery's enduring 200-year history.

The brewery's main brand, Kirakucho (喜楽長), was established at its founding and carries a profound cultural meaning. The name is a composite of three Japanese characters: *Ki* (喜) for happiness, *Raku* (楽) for fun or a good time, and *Cho* (長) for long life. This name embodies the brewery's wish for its customers to lead long, happy lives while enjoying their sake on any occasion. For generations, the Kita family has upheld this tradition, with the brewery currently led by 8th-generation president Yoshimichi Kita, maintaining a consistent focus on quality and a deep connection to the local community and its natural environment.

A significant modern milestone for the brewery is the transition to the 9th generation, represented by Mayuko Kita. Having decided on her career path since middle school, she returned to the brewery in 2015 after earning a finance degree and gaining experience in the food industry. Mayuko Kita has since taken on the dual role of owner and *Toji* (Master Brewer), a notable achievement for a woman in the traditionally male-dominated sake industry. She has embraced the Noto Toji Guild's style of brewing, which emphasizes propagating quality *koji* and managing a slow, gradual fermentation process to ensure full flavor development.

Mayuko Kita's philosophy centers on the belief that "sake is living," asserting that the role of the brewing team is not to "make" the sake, but to "nurture" or "raise" it, guiding its development using the natural elements of the local water, yeast, *koji*, and the cold winter climate. This approach results in a sake that she describes as *taoyaka*, a Japanese term signifying a graceful and supple character with a rich core of umami. By focusing on locally grown rice and traditional, meticulous methods, Kita Brewing Company ensures its products reflect a strong sense of place and a style that is both elegant and deeply flavorful, securing the brewery's legacy for future generations.

## Kiyasho Sake Brewery

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1818 (Bunsei era)  
**Founder:** Shohachi Onishi, originally a lumber merchant who established the business that became the brewery.  
**Location:** Nabari City, Mie Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing the highly sought-after 'Jikon' sake brand, known for its 'New School' style—bright, effervescent, and slightly sweet—often using special yeasts and premium rice varieties like Omachi and Senbonnishiki.  

### History

Kiyasho Sake Brewery, also known as Kiyasho Shuzo, was established in 1818, the first year of the Bunsei era, by Shohachi Onishi [3] [6]. The brewery is located in Nabari City, Mie Prefecture, a historic town that retains the atmosphere of an inn town on the Hatsuse Kaido road, which historically connected Nara and Kyoto to the revered Ise Shrine [1]. The name "Kiyasho" (木屋正) is derived from the business's original trade, as the Onishi family began as a lumber merchant before transitioning into sake brewing [1] [7]. The brewery's location in the Iga Basin is crucial, as the area is blessed with fertile soil and clear water from the Nagara River, which is fed by underground springs from the Kii Mountains. This environment provides the high-quality water and local Iga rice essential for premium sake production [1].

The brewery has a deep connection to the local cultural heritage of Nabari. During the Edo period (1603-1867), the Kiyasho Brewery housed a temple and childcare center called "Eijyudo" on its premises, marking it as one of the earliest educational centers in the region [1]. Furthermore, Nabari is often considered the birthplace of Nohgaku, a traditional Japanese performing art, which underscores the area's rich historical and cultural significance. This long-standing presence in a culturally important town highlights the brewery's role as a traditional industry that encapsulates the essence of the region [1].

A major turning point in the brewery's modern history occurred with the return of the sixth-generation owner, Tadayoshi Onishi (also known as Tada Onishi). After gaining two years of brewing experience under a master brewer, he took over the small family brewery in 2003 at the age of 27 [4] [6]. In 2005, he launched the brewery's now-famous premium brand, "Jikon" (而今) [5]. The name "Jikon" is a Zen phrase, coined by Zenji Dogen, which translates to "The Present Moment," reflecting the philosophy to "focus on the present moment and make the most of it" [1]. This philosophy guides the brewery's approach to sake-making, which balances respect for traditional Japanese methods with the adoption of the latest technology [1].

Under Tadayoshi Onishi's leadership, Kiyasho Shuzo has become a highly respected producer, particularly for its "Jikon" brand, which is often associated with the "New School" wave of sake brewing [5]. This style is characterized by a bright, effervescent, and slightly sweet profile, appealing to a modern palate [5]. The brewery is dedicated to honest and sincere brewing, focusing on the quality of its koji mold and yeast, and fostering strong relationships with its distributors and consumers [1]. By embracing both tradition and innovation, Kiyasho Sake Brewery aims to demonstrate the dignity of its endeavor and pass on the sake culture to the next generation [1].

## Kizakura Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1925  
**Founder:** Jiichiro Matsumoto, who split off from his family's established sake brewery in Fushimi.  
**Location:** Fushimi City, Kyoto Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Use of "Fushimizu" spring water, a medium-hard water ideal for sake brewing, and the traditional Yamahai fermentation technique for certain sake lines. Also noted as the first craft beer brewery in Kyoto (since 1995).  

### History

Kizakura Co., Ltd. was founded in October 1925 by Jiichiro Matsumoto in the Fushimi district of Kyoto [1] [2]. Matsumoto established the company as a branch family, splitting off from his family's larger, established sake brewery in the area [3]. Fushimi is renowned for its abundant underground spring water, known as "Fushimizu," which is a medium-hard water considered one of the most suitable for sake brewing, lending a mild and smooth character to the final product [4]. The brewery's name, Kizakura, is derived from a rare variety of "Satozakura" cherry tree that produces yellow double-petaled blossoms, a symbol chosen by the founder for its unique ambiance [4].

While considered a relative newcomer to the centuries-old Fushimi sake scene, Kizakura quickly grew, officially incorporating in December 1951 [2]. A major factor in their success was their innovative corporate strategy and commitment to quality, which helped them become one of Japan's top sake producers [5]. A key element of their brand identity is the mythical Japanese creature, the **Kappa**, which serves as the company's unique image character and symbol, famously featured in their popular TV commercials [3]. This cultural branding helped Kizakura gain widespread recognition across Japan.

Kizakura has consistently combined traditional brewing secrets with modern techniques. They utilize the traditional **Yamahai** fermentation technique for certain sake lines, a time-consuming process that yields a complex and mellow flavor profile [6]. Demonstrating a spirit of innovation, Kizakura diversified its production in 1995 by becoming the first craft beer brewery in Kyoto, applying their sake brewing skills to create unique beers, some of which use sake yeast and the same Fushimizu water [4]. The company's commitment to excellence is evidenced by the Misugura brewery, built in 1964, which has won the gold medal 10 times since 2003 [3]. In 2016, they further expanded their presence by opening the "Fushimi-gura" brewery and museum, offering visitors a chance to learn about both sake and craft beer production [4]. Kizakura continues to be a major force in the Japanese sake industry, ranking among the top 10 in sales volume [3].

## Kodama Brewing Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1879  
**Founder:** Kumeinosuke Kodama, who started the business as a soy sauce and miso producer  
**Location:** Katagami City, Akita Prefecture  
**Specialty:** The development of the Akita Kimoto Method, a modern, modified version of the traditional Kimoto method, later refined to Taiheizan Kaden Kimoto.  

### History

Kodama Brewing Co., Ltd., also known as Kodama Jozo, was established in 1879 (Meiji 12) in Katagami City, Akita Prefecture, a region blessed with abundant quality rice and clean mountain water. The founder, Kumeinosuke Kodama, initially focused the family business on producing traditional Japanese fermented food products, namely miso and shoyu (soy sauce), under the Yamakiu brand. This foundation in fermentation and local production of essential seasonings laid the groundwork for the brewery's future expansion into sake production. The family's commitment to quality and the local community quickly established them as a key producer in the region.

The brewery's pivotal moment came in 1913 when the second-generation head of the family business, Tomokichi Kodama, began brewing sake under the brand name "TAIHEIZAN" (Great Peaceful Mountain), named after the towering mountain in Akita City. This new venture quickly gained national recognition, particularly with the introduction of TAIHEIZAN-REIRO in 1933, which is noted as Japan's first chilled *ginjo* sake. The following year, in 1934, the brewery cemented its reputation by winning first place at the 14th Annual National Sake Competition, a significant achievement that allowed the company to expand its market to Tokyo and establish *Taiheizan* as a national brand.

A core element of Kodama Jozo's cultural and technical significance is its pioneering work in brewing methods. In the 1950s, the brewery developed the "Akita Kimoto Method," a modern, modified version of the traditional, labor-intensive *kimoto* process. This technique uses a hand-operated electric pole to stir the *moto* (yeast starter), creating an ideal anaerobic environment that accelerates the growth of lactic-acid bacteria. This results in a strong, clean *moto* that is resistant to the cold Akita climate, enabling prolonged, low-temperature fermentation that imparts the sake with an aromatic, complex flavor profile. The brewery has since refined this technique, now calling it "Taiheizan Kaden Kimoto."

In 1989, the brewery launched "TENKO," a completely hand-made *junmai daiginjo* that became a pioneer in the growing market for chilled, premium sake. *TENKO* has since garnered international acclaim, winning Gold in the Monde Selection in Brussels in 2000 and numerous awards at the U.S. National Sake Appraisals and the International Wine Challenge (IWC). Today, under the leadership of the fifth generation, Shinichiro Kodama, the company continues to produce sake, miso, and shoyu. Furthermore, the historical significance of the family is preserved, as the Kodama Family Residence, built in 1923, was declared an Important National Cultural Property in 2008, symbolizing the family's deep roots and contribution to the region's heritage.

## Kojima Sohonten

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1597  
**Founder:** Yazaemon Kojima, founder of Kojima Sakaya and first in a line of 23 generations of family heads  
**Location:** Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on traditional craftsmanship, natural ingredients, and sustainability, including the *sakeyondan shikomi* (four-step brewing method) and the use of pesticide-free rice cultivated with the *Aigamo* method.  

### History

Kojima Sohonten, one of Japan's oldest sake breweries, was founded in 1597 (Keicho 2) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period by Yazaemon Kojima in Yonezawa, which was then the territory of the Gamou clan. Initially established as Kojima Sakaya, the business served the dual function of a sake brewery and a pawnshop. The brewery's history is deeply intertwined with the powerful Uesugi clan, for whom Kojima Sakaya became the exclusive sake purveyor after the clan's relocation to Yonezawa around 1603. This privileged position allowed them to continue brewing even during periods of famine when alcohol production was otherwise prohibited.

The family's status was further cemented in 1757 when a Yazaemon Kojima was recognized for his contributions and promoted to ward head, granting the family the rare permission to use surnames and carry swords, effectively elevating them to samurai status. By the late Edo period, the brewery was a significant producer, with records from 1791 showing a brewing yield of 490 koku (88.2 kiloliters), making them the largest producer in the neighborhood. The brewery's location was also strategically important, situated along the road used by the daimyo for the mandatory Sankin-kotai journey to Tokyo.

The modern era saw the private industry of Kojima Sakaya converted into a stock company, Kojima Sohonten, in 1952. The name, meaning "the original," was chosen to distinguish the brewery from other alcohol-related businesses run by relatives. A major cultural milestone occurred in 1984 with the opening of the Toko Sake Museum, housed in a traditionally-built, nail-less structure that had previously been the operating brewery. This museum, the largest brewery exhibition in the Tohoku region, won the Yonezawa City Scenery Award.

More recently, the brewery has gained international recognition, winning the prestigious Daiginjo Trophy at the International Wine Challenge in 2014. The brewery continues to operate with a philosophy that emphasizes a deep respect for nature and craftsmanship, focusing on quality rice and the clean, soft water from the nearby Mogami River. The current head of the family is the 23rd descendent to bear the name Yazaemon Kojima.

## Konishi Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1550 (Tenbun 19)  
**Founder:** Konishi Shinuemon Sōgo's grandfather, who started the family business as a pharmacist. The first generation to take the hereditary name Shinuemon Sōgo was born in 1592.  
**Location:** Itami City, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering the "Shirayuki" (White Snow) brand, the oldest existing sake brand in Japan. They also specialize in the traditional *Morohaku* brewing technique and have a unique focus on aging sake, as evidenced by their *Shirayuki Kanza Aged Vintage Sake*.  

### History

Konishi Brewing Company, located in Itami City, Hyogo Prefecture, is one of Japan's oldest family-run sake breweries, with a history stretching back over 470 years. The company's origins trace back to 1550 (Tenbun 19), when the grandfather of the first Konishi Shinuemon Sōgo began a business as a pharmacist in Itami, which is recognized as the birthplace of *Seishu* (refined sake). Sake brewing began as a side business to complement the pharmaceutical enterprise. This dual-business model continued until 1612, when the family shifted its primary focus entirely to sake production, leveraging the advanced brewing techniques developed in the Itami region.

A major milestone occurred around 1635, when the second-generation head, Sotaku Konishi, was transporting sake barrels. Upon seeing the snow-capped Mount Fuji, he was so moved by its noble and pure appearance that he named his sake brand "Shirayuki" (White Snow). Shirayuki has since become the oldest existing sake brand in Japan. The company's historical significance is further cemented by the preservation of the *Sake Eitai Oboecho*, a record of sake brewing from the Edo period (1603-1868) passed down through the Konishi family, which serves as a vital historical document for sake production.

Throughout its long history, the Konishi family has maintained a philosophy of "immutability," which emphasizes an unchanging essential nature amidst constant challenge and the search for novelty. This commitment has led to both the preservation of traditional methods, such as the *Morohaku* brewing technique, and the embrace of modern innovation. Notable achievements include the adoption of the hereditary name "Shinuemon" by the head of the family, a tradition that continues to the 15th generation, Shintarō Konishi, who assumed the name in 2020. The brewery also pioneered the use of a highly productive, four-season brewing factory in 1963, known as "NO.2 FUJIYAMA GURA," a first in the Japanese sake industry.

Today, Konishi Brewing Company continues to operate from Itami, Hyogo, focusing on producing high-quality sake, including their flagship Shirayuki brand, while also diversifying into other ventures like Belgian beer imports. Their products, such as the *Super Special Shirayuki Itami Morohaku*, have received international recognition, including the International Wine Challenge Gold Trophy, affirming their status as a historical and contemporary leader in the sake world. The company's enduring legacy is a testament to its deep roots in the birthplace of sake and its continuous pursuit of excellence.

## Kurosawa Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1858 (Ansei 5 era)  
**Founder:** Rizaemon Kurosawa, who started the business for local supply and expanded it into a diverse "Kurosawa Konzern" during the Meiji era.  
**Location:** Sakuho-cho, Minamisaku-gun, Nagano Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Kimoto method, a traditional, labor-intensive brewing technique used for approximately 60% of their sake, resulting in a thick-bodied, rich-flavored product. They also focus on using 100% Nagano-cropped rice and unique aging experiments.  

### History

Kurosawa Brewing Company was founded in 1858 (Ansei 5 era) by Rizaemon Kurosawa in the high-mountain region of Sakuho-cho, Nagano Prefecture. Rizaemon began brewing sake to supply the local community, a venture officially sanctioned by a sake stock certificate (permission to brew sake) received from the county governor, which is still carefully preserved by the brewery today [1] [4]. The brewery is situated in a rich natural environment, surrounded by mountains like Mt. Asama and Mt. Yatsugatake, and is near the headstream of the Chikuma River (known as the Shinanogawa in other parts of Nagano) [1]. This pristine location provides the soft, high-quality subterranean water essential for their brewing process [1].

Under the leadership of Rizaemon, the brewery quickly grew beyond its initial scope. During the Meiji era, the founder ambitiously expanded the family's enterprises, aiming to establish a "Kurosawa Konzern" that diversified into various businesses, including banking, textiles, miso/soy sauce, and medicine [4] [5]. This early entrepreneurial spirit laid a strong foundation for the company's longevity. Today, the brewery is managed by the sixth generation of the family, with Takao Kurosawa serving as the representative and Yohei Kurosawa, the brew master (toji) since 2009, overseeing the production [2].

The core of Kurosawa's brewing philosophy is a deep respect for tradition and the natural resources of the region, combined with a willingness to embrace new challenges. The brewery is a strong proponent of local agriculture, using 100% Nagano-cropped rice and engaging in contract farming with local producers, embodying their philosophy of "農・酒・呑・生活 (No Sake, No Life)" [1]. This commitment to the local community and environment is also reflected in their cultural efforts, such as the adjacent Sake Museum, which was established by renovating an old warehouse to showcase the history of both the brewery and the local Sakuho culture [1].

The brewery's primary specialty is the traditional and labor-intensive **Kimoto method** ("kimoto-zukuri"), which is used for approximately 60% of their sake production [6]. This age-old technique requires twice the time of modern methods to prepare the yeast starter but is crucial for producing their signature thick-bodied sake with great depth and rich flavor [1]. In recent years, the company has also pursued innovative aging techniques, experimenting with maturing sake in unique environments such as a prefectural dam's maintenance tunnel, under the snow at a ski resort, and in aged wine barrels, alongside developing other local alcoholic beverages like craft gin and shochu [1].

## Mioya Shuzo Co., Ltd. (御祖酒造株式会社)

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1921 (Meiji 30, with 1897 as the historical founding year)  
**Founder:** Unknown (The brewery was not founded by the current family, and records for the original 1897 founder are unavailable)  
**Location:** Hakui City, Ishikawa Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Focus on crafting *shokuchu-shu* (sake for food pairing) with pronounced acidity and umami, often utilizing the traditional *kimoto* method and a "rule-breaking" approach to brewing.  

### History

Mioya Shuzo, located in Hakui City, Ishikawa Prefecture, has a complex history marked by an initial founding in the Meiji era and a modern revival. The brewery's historical founding year is often cited as **1897** (Meiji 30), though due to a lack of surviving documentation, the official founding year registered with the government is **1921** [1] [2]. The brewery was originally named Goso Shuzo, after the local village of Mioya, and for decades produced a local sake brand called "Homare" (ほまれ), primarily a *futsushu* (table sake) for local farmers and consumption [3] [4]. The name of the original founder from 1897 is not recorded in the available public documentation.

The brewery faced a crisis in the late 20th century, eventually leading to its financial collapse. In **2000**, the brewery was purchased by the father of Miho Fujita, a native of Hakui, when the business was on the brink of bankruptcy [5]. Miho Fujita, who was working in a successful marketing career in Tokyo, initially had no plans to join the sake industry. However, following the sudden passing of her uncle, who was running the business, she decided to step in and took over the management in **2003** [5]. This marked a pivotal turning point, as she became one of the few female brewery presidents in the male-dominated sake world [3].

Under Miho Fujita's leadership, the brewery underwent a complete transformation. In **2005**, she recruited Toshiaki Yokomichi, a young and talented *Noto Toji* (master brewer) from Osaka, who shared her vision of creating a new style of sake [4] [6]. Their collaboration led to the creation of the new brand, **"Yuho"** (遊穂), which is the brewery's flagship product today [3]. The brand's name is a playful nod to the town of Hakui's reputation as the "UFO capital of Japan" [7]. This new direction focused on crafting *shokuchu-shu* (sake meant to be paired with food) with pronounced acidity and umami, a style that broke from the local tradition of lighter, sweeter sakes [6].

Mioya Shuzo continues to operate in Hakui, Ishikawa, and has gained international recognition for its "Yuho" brand, which is known for its bold, savory, and complex flavor profile [8]. The brewery's commitment to traditional methods, such as the *kimoto* method, combined with a modern, rule-breaking spirit, has cemented its status as a trailblazer in the sake industry [5]. The brewery was also noted for its resilience after the 2024 New Year's Day earthquake, which damaged the facility but did not prevent it from serving the community [5].

## Nakao Sake Brewery Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1871  
**Founder:** Hiroshimaya Gihachi, a rice merchant who originally operated under the name 'Hiroshimaya'  
**Location:** Takehara City, Hiroshima Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering development of original apple yeast (1940) and the High-temperature Yeast Mash Saccharification method (1947) by 4th generation Kiyoma Nakao.  

### History

Nakao Sake Brewery Co., Ltd. was established in 1871 (Meiji 4) in the picturesque town of Takehara, Hiroshima Prefecture, a region known for its historical significance and proximity to the Seto Inland Sea [1]. The brewery was founded by Hiroshimaya Gihachi, a local rice merchant, and initially operated under the name "Hiroshimaya" [2]. The brewery's signature brand, "Seikyo," which translates to "True Mirror," was born from the founder's core philosophy: a wish that "the sake poured into a cup may be like a mirror, with the quality of the sake reflecting the sincerity in our brewers’ hearts as they devote themselves to sake brewing" [1]. This dedication to sincerity and quality has been the guiding principle for the brewery across its generations.

A major turning point in the brewery's history came with the 4th generation head, Kiyoma Nakao, who became a pioneer in sake brewing science. In 1927, Kiyoma began extensive research into yeast in collaboration with the renowned agricultural chemist and microbiologist Kinichiro Sakaguchi [1]. This research led to two significant innovations that would impact the entire sake industry. In 1940, Kiyoma successfully developed an original apple yeast, which imparts a distinctive aroma and flavor profile to their sake. This was followed in 1947 by the development of the High-temperature Yeast Mash Saccharification method, a technique that improved the efficiency and quality of the brewing process [1]. These innovations quickly brought national recognition, with the brewery winning first prize in a national competition in 1948 and being chosen for the Imperial Household New Year Celebration for three consecutive years starting in 1949 [1].

In the modern era, Nakao Sake Brewery has continued its legacy of innovation and excellence. In 1974, the brewery launched its premium "Maboroshi" brand, which is brewed using the original apple yeast and was presented to the Imperial Household [1]. The brewery has consistently garnered international acclaim, including gold medals for its "Maboroshi Kurobako" at the International Wine Challenge (IWC) in 2007 and the U.S. National Sake Appraisal in 2015 [1]. Nakao Sake Brewery remains a six-generation family business, committed to the traditional methods and innovative spirit that have defined its history, while continuing to produce high-quality sake that honors the founder's vision of the "True Mirror" [3].

## Nanbu Bijin Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1902  
**Founder:** Sueta Kuji, who established the brewery after running a soy sauce business.  
**Location:** Ninohe City, Iwate Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing "clean and beautiful" sake, using local Iwate-grown sake rice varieties "Gin Ginga" and "Gin Otome," and pioneering the production of sugar-additive-free plum liqueur.  

### History

The history of Nanbu Bijin, which translates to "Southern Beauty," begins in **1902** in Ninohe City, Iwate Prefecture, a region historically known as Nanbu [1]. The brewery was founded by **Sueta Kuji**, whose family had previously been engaged in the soy sauce brewing business in Ichinohe [1] [3]. Initially named Kuji Shuzo, the brewery began producing sake based on the techniques of soy sauce brewing, with the first production volume estimated at a modest 7.5kg [1]. Following Sueta Kuji's early death, his wife, Nayo Kuji, took over the business until their son, Hideo Kuji, was old enough to succeed [1].

A major turning point occurred in **1951** when Hideo Kuji, the third successor, began working with the Nanbu Toji, a renowned Master Brewer group from Iwate [1]. At the suggestion of the local Tax Office director, the sake brand was officially named **Nanbu Bijin**, linking the location of "Nanbu" with the desired "Bijin" (beautiful) taste of the sake [1] [3]. This era also saw the collaboration with Master Brewer Hajime Yamaguchi, who brought the spirit and technique of the esteemed Sagoro Hirano, emphasizing the importance of high-quality koji and proper storehouse management [1]. This commitment to quality over the common sweet sake of the time set the brewery on a path toward distinction [3].

The brewery has consistently embraced innovation while honoring tradition. In the 1990s, Kosuke Kuji, the current and fifth-generation president, joined the company and began challenging new sake-making techniques with the guidance of the older generation [1]. This forward-thinking approach led to the company changing its name to Nanbu Bijin Co., Ltd. in **2001** [1]. The brewery has also been a pioneer in the export market, contributing to the establishment of the Sake Export Association [1]. A notable milestone was the development of a **sugar-additive-free plum liqueur** in 2008, a product that received a Japanese patent for its production method [1].

Nanbu Bijin has achieved significant international recognition, most notably winning the prestigious **IWC Champion Sake** award at the International Wine Challenge in 2017 [2]. The brewery's commitment to using local ingredients is evident in its use of original sake rice varieties like **"Gin Ginga"** and **"Gin Otome,"** which are cultivated in Ninohe City [2] [3]. Today, Nanbu Bijin is celebrated globally for its "clean and beautiful" sake, a testament to its blend of Nanbu tradition and modern, quality-focused brewing techniques [3].

## Nanbu Brewing Company (南部酒造場)

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1733 (Kyōhō era)  
**Founder:** Shichiemon (七右衛門), founder of the original hardware store "Chanokiya" and purveyor to the Ōno domain. Sake brewing was started by the sixth-generation head, Teizo (悌蔵), in 1901.  
**Location:** Ōno City, Fukui Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Aged sake (Koshu), including the "Yūkyū no Kakusei" series aged for 10 and 20 years, and innovative French oak barrel-aged Junmai Daiginjo.  

### History

Nanbu Brewing Company, known for its "Hanagaki" brand, traces its origins back to the Edo period in Ōno City, Fukui Prefecture. The company was first established in 1733 (Kyōhō 18) by the first-generation head, Shichiemon (七右衛門), as a hardware store named "Chanokiya" (茶の木屋), which served as a purveyor to the local Ōno domain [1] [2]. The family business continued in this capacity for over a century and a half.

The transition to sake brewing occurred in 1901 (Meiji 34), when the sixth-generation head, Teizo (悌蔵), shifted the family business from hardware to sake production following a series of major fires in the Ōno city center [1] [3]. This marked the true founding of the sake brewery. The brand name "Hanagaki" (花垣) was chosen because the rich and elegant flavor of the newly brewed sake was likened to a fence of blooming cherry blossoms, a word associated with good fortune and hope [3].

The seventh-generation head, Shuzo (修三), significantly advanced the brewery's reputation by traveling to famous brewing regions across Japan to master sake technology. His efforts led to high scores in sake exhibitions, and in 1933 (Shōwa 8), the Hanagaki sake was selected as a special presentation sake for the Imperial Army's maneuvers in Fukui [3] [4]. The eighth-generation head, Tadao (忠生), navigated the company through the hardships of World War II, successfully restoring production to over 2,000 koku (a traditional measure of sake volume) [3].

In 2001, the brewery celebrated its 100th anniversary of sake brewing. The company's commitment to tradition and quality was recognized when five of its historic brewery buildings were designated as Registered Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan [2]. Today, under the leadership of the ninth and tenth generations, the brewery continues to focus on traditional, handmade brewing methods while also embracing modernization. A notable recent discovery was an Edo-period well found beneath the *zashiki* (traditional reception room) during renovations in 2021 [3].

A key specialty of Nanbu Shuzo is its dedication to **aged sake (Koshu)**, which it has been developing for over two decades [5]. The brewery produces a variety of aged sakes, including the "Yūkyū no Kakusei" (悠久の覚醒め - Awakening of Eternity) series, with vintages aged for 10 and 20 years, and even unique offerings like Junmai Daiginjo aged in French oak barrels [5] [6]. This focus on long-term maturation and innovative aging techniques distinguishes Nanbu Shuzo in the sake industry.

## Nihonsakari Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1889  
**Founder:** Unknown (Established by a group of young members of the Nishinomiya Kigyo Company)  
**Location:** Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering health-conscious sake (e.g., "Kenjo," low-carb/no-purine sake), early adoption of television advertising, and diversification into rice bran cosmetics ("Komenuka Bijin"). The brewery also benefits from the region's Miyamizu water and the expertise of Tamba master brewers.  

### History

Nihonsakari Co., Ltd. traces its origins to 1889, when it was established as the Nishinomiya Kigyo Company by a group of young entrepreneurs and members of the Yuikai association. Their mission was to contribute to the development and industrial growth of Nishinomiya, a city already renowned as part of the Nada-Gogo sake brewing region in Hyogo Prefecture. The company quickly established a reputation for its "quality-first" policy, developing unique brewing methods that resulted in high-quality sake with distinct flavor and aroma. This early success was cemented in 1913 when their "Nihonsakari" brand, specifically the "Souhana" label, was selected as a purveyor of sake for the Imperial Household Agency, a distinction it maintains to this day [1].

The brewery continued to grow and adapt throughout the 20th century. In 1896, the company changed its name to Nishinomiya Shuzo Co., Ltd. and later, in 2000, adopted its current name, Nihonsakari Co., Ltd. A major milestone in its public profile was achieved in 1961 when it broadcasted the sake industry's first-ever television commercial, significantly boosting its brand recognition across Japan. This period of growth was characterized by modernization, rationalization of processing, and an increase in output, driven by technological innovations such as the shift to year-round brewing to meet rising demand [1].

Nihonsakari has consistently demonstrated a spirit of innovation beyond traditional sake production. In 1987, the company diversified its portfolio by releasing its first cosmetics line, "Komenuka Bijin" (Rice Bran Beauty), utilizing the byproducts of sake brewing. Furthermore, the company has been a pioneer in developing health-conscious sake products, such as the "Kenjo" sake in 1995, which was the industry's first health-concept sake, and later, the release of sake with reduced carbohydrates and no purine body in 2015. These efforts reflect the company's motto of "Experience and Adventure" and its commitment to adapting to changing consumer lifestyles [1].

The brewery's location in Nishinomiya City, within the Nada-Gogo region, is culturally significant, as this area is famous for its high-quality water, Miyamizu, and its traditional use of Tamba master brewers (Tōji). Today, Nihonsakari remains a major player in the sake industry, balancing its deep-rooted tradition, exemplified by its Imperial Household purveyor status, with a forward-looking approach to product development and market expansion. The opening of the "Sakagura-dori Rengakan" facility in 2000 further solidified its role as a cultural center for Japanese sake information [1].

## Niizawa Sake Brewery Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1873  
**Founder:** Nakayoshi Niizawa, founder of Niizawa Shoten Co. and the first generation of the family to run the brewery.  
**Location:** Kawasaki Town, Miyagi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering the "ultimate food sake" (*Hakurakusei*) philosophy; known for sakes with extreme rice polishing ratios (e.g., *Zankyo* 9% and *Reikyo* 0%); and a progressive, collaborative brewing culture led by the youngest female *Toji* in Japan.  

### History

Niizawa Sake Brewery was founded in 1873 (Meiji 6) by Nakayoshi Niizawa as Niizawa Shoten Co. in Sanbongi, Osaki City, Miyagi Prefecture. The brewery has been family-run since its inception, with the name changing to Niizawa Sake Brewery in 1895 and then to Niizawa Brewery in 1907. A significant early milestone occurred in 1925 when the main brand was renamed "Atago no Matsu" after the pine tree on Mt. Atago, following a presentation in front of the future Emperor Showa. The brewery established its corporate structure as Niizawa Brewery Co. in 1950, with the second-generation Junkichi Niizawa appointed as the first president.

The brewery faced its greatest challenge on March 11, 2011, when the Great East Japan Earthquake completely destroyed its 138-year-old facility in Osaki City. Under the leadership of the fifth-generation owner, Iwao Niizawa, the company made the monumental decision to relocate and rebuild the brewing facility 70 kilometers away in Kawasaki Town, Shibata District, Miyagi Prefecture. Remarkably, the new facility was constructed and brewing resumed by November of the same year, a testament to the brewery's resilience and determination. The head office functions, however, remain in Osaki City.

The modern era of the brewery is defined by its commitment to innovation and a clear brewing philosophy. In 2002, Iwao Niizawa launched the brand *Hakurakusei*, which embodies the brewery's core concept of creating the "ultimate food sake"—a sake designed to enhance the dining experience rather than dominate it. This pursuit of perfection led to the development of sakes with extreme rice polishing ratios, such as the *Zankyo Super Special Junmai Daiginjo* with a 9% polish in 2009, and the groundbreaking *Reikyo -Absolute 0-* with a 0% polish in 2018, pushing the boundaries of traditional sake making.

Niizawa also champions a progressive and collaborative brewing culture. In 2018, Iwao Niizawa stepped down as *Toji* (master brewer) to appoint Nanami Watanabe, who, at 22, became the youngest female *Toji* in Japan. This move reflects a non-hierarchical environment where all brewers (*kurabito*) collaborate and learn from each other, regardless of age or experience. This modern approach has been met with international acclaim, with the brewery winning the prestigious "Sake Brewer of the year" at the International Wine Challenge (IWC) and "Most Valuable Producer (MVP)" at the Oriental Sake Awards for four consecutive years (2022-2025), solidifying its status as a world-class sake producer.

## Ninki Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1897  
**Founder:** Yujin Yusa, former president of his family's 300-year-old brewery, Okunomatsu Brewing Company.  
**Location:** Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Exclusive focus on Ginjo-grade sake and higher, utilizing traditional methods like Kioke Jikomi (wooden tank brewing) alongside modern innovations such as sparkling sake and the "space sake" project.  

### History

The brewery that would become Ninki Brewing Company traces its origins back to 1897 in Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture. However, the modern history of the company began in 2007 when it was purchased and re-established by Yujin Yusa. Yusa, who had previously served as the president of his family's long-established brewery, Okunomatsu Brewing Company, took over the struggling 1897 brewery. His primary motivation was the unique opportunity to acquire a facility that held licenses not only for sake but also for shochu, liqueur, and spirits, which are difficult to obtain in Japan.

Under Yusa's leadership, the brewery was rebranded as NINKI INC. (marketed as Ninki-Ichi) and adopted a radical, uncompromising philosophy: to only brew premium Ginjo-grade sake or higher. This commitment was a direct challenge to the industry's focus on futsushu (table sake). The brewery also committed to making sake entirely by hand, eschewing modern automation to ensure quality and preserve traditional craftsmanship. This dedication to tradition is exemplified by their revival of the Kioke Jikomi method, which involves brewing in traditional wooden cedar tanks.

Despite its traditional methods, Ninki is highly regarded for its innovative spirit and modern approach to sake consumption. They have pioneered products like high-quality sparkling sake and sake specifically designed to be enjoyed in wine glasses, aiming to appeal to a new generation of drinkers. A notable milestone that brought international attention was the "space sake" project, where yeast was sent to the International Space Station. This yeast was then used to brew a special sake, symbolizing the brewery's blend of ancient craft and modern science.

The company's dual identity—rooted in a 19th-century establishment but reborn in the 21st century—positions it as a bridge between the historical legacy of Fukushima sake brewing and its future. By focusing exclusively on high-grade, handcrafted sake, Ninki Brewing Company has quickly established itself as a refined and innovative brand in the global sake market.

## Nishide Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1913  
**Founder:** Unknown (Original founder was a family member); revived by Hirohisa Nishide, fifth-generation head and master brewer  
**Location:** Komatsu City, Ishikawa Prefecture  
**Specialty:** The brewery specializes in traditional brewing methods, notably the Kimoto and Yamahai methods, for its core "Harugokoro" line. A unique specialty is the use of natural, locally-sourced yeast, including fermented yeast from the double cherry blossoms of Kenrokuen Garden (Kenroku Zakura series) and fermented yeast from geraniums on Mt. Hakusan (Shirayama Fuuro Honjozo). All ingredients are sourced from Ishikawa Prefecture.  

### History

Nishide Brewing Company, known locally as Nishide Shuzo, was founded in 1913 (Taisho 2) in Komatsu City, Ishikawa Prefecture. The brewery operated as a small, family-run business for decades, establishing a local reputation for its sake, notably under the brand name "Harugokoro." However, like many small breweries, it faced severe financial difficulties in the late 20th century.

The brewery's history was interrupted in 1996 when, due to economic hardship, the company's trade name was changed to Kinmon Shuzo, and the original "Harugokoro" brand was replaced with "Kinmon." Furthermore, the management of the brewery was transferred from the Nishide family to an external owner. This marked a period of uncertainty for the family's brewing legacy.

The revival of the brewery is credited to Hirohisa Nishide, the fifth-generation head. Although he initially studied information technology, he left university at age 19 to pursue the craft of sake brewing. From 2001, he apprenticed for five years under the renowned Noto Toji (master brewer), Naohiko Noguchi, at Kano Shuzo. He returned to the family brewery in 2006 to brew alongside his father. Following his father's death in 2012, and faced with the new owner's decision to cease operations, Hirohisa Nishide took decisive action.

In 2014, Hirohisa Nishide successfully raised the necessary funds to buy back the brewery, restoring the original company name, Nishide Shuzo, and reviving the beloved "Harugokoro" brand. Today, the brewery operates as a small-scale, local enterprise with only three employees, with Hirohisa Nishide serving as both the representative and the master brewer. The brewery is a testament to the dedication of a family to preserve its heritage and the traditional craft of sake making.

## OTOKOYAMA CO., LTD.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1887  
**Founder:** Unknown (The brewery was founded as Yamazaki Shuzo in 1887; the name of the first-generation founder is not explicitly stated in the available sources, but the company is run by the Yamazaki family)  
**Location:** Asahikawa City, Hokkaido Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing sake with pure mountain spring water from the Daisetsuzan mountains and utilizing the severe cold climate of Asahikawa for a clear and dry taste. Notable for being the first sake to win the Monde Selection Grand Gold Medal in 1977.  

### History

The history of the Otokoyama brand is complex, tracing its roots back to the Edo period (1603-1867) in Itami, Kansai, where it was first brewed by Yamamoto Saemon under the name "Momenya" [1] [2]. This original Otokoyama was highly regarded, even earning the status of "Gomenshu," or official sake purveyor, to the Edo shogunate [1] [3]. The Otokoyama brand, which translates to "Man's Mountain," was popular enough to be featured in traditional Japanese arts like Kabuki, Joruri, and Ukiyo-e [1].

The current Otokoyama brewery in Hokkaido, however, began its history separately in 1887 as Yamazaki Shuzo in Sapporo, later relocating to Asahikawa in 1899 [4] [5]. The Yamazaki family, who ran Yamazaki Shuzo, eventually acquired the rights and tradition of the prestigious Otokoyama name from the descendants of the original Itami brewers in 1968 [3] [6]. This acquisition allowed the Hokkaido brewery to inherit the 350-year-old legacy of the Otokoyama brand, effectively merging the historical significance of the name with the frontier spirit of Hokkaido [3].

The brewery, now officially Otokoyama Co., Ltd., is located in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, a region known for its severe cold and the pure spring water from the Daisetsuzan mountains, which is crucial to their brewing process [1] [7]. The brewery has achieved significant international recognition, becoming the first sake in the world to win the Monde Selection Grand Gold Medal in 1977, an award it has continued to win for over 40 consecutive years [1]. The company's current representative is Yokichi Yamazaki [7]. The brewery also operates the Otokoyama Sake Brewery Museum, which showcases the history of the brand and the culture of sake brewing [2].

## Okunomatsu Sake Brewery Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1716  
**Founder:** Kinnojo Yusa, an ancestor of the current family who was a former samurai (ronin) of the Hatakeyama clan and a successful merchant.  
**Location:** Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering the use of post-bottling pasteurization (showering bottles with warm water) and employing a "New Age Ginjo" technique that involves adding ready-made Junmai Ginjo sake to the mash just before pressing.  

### History

Okunomatsu Sake Brewery Co., Ltd. was founded in 1716, during the Edo period, in Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture [1]. The brewery's history is rooted in the samurai class, as the founder's ancestor, Kinnojo Yusa, was a retainer of the Hatakeyama clan. Following the clan's defeat and the death of their lord in 1585, the family became *ronin* (masterless samurai). They settled in Nihonmatsu and successfully transitioned into commerce, prospering as merchants who dealt in canola oil, miso paste, and soy sauce before establishing the sake brewing business [1].

The brewery's name, Okunomatsu, is derived from the region, and its location at the foot of Mt. Adatara provides access to the pure, clean water essential for high-quality sake production [2]. The company's philosophy is centered on the dual principles of "thoroughly executing the basics" and "constant innovation," a spirit that has been passed down through 19 generations of sake brewing [1] [3]. This commitment to both tradition and progress has been a major factor in the brewery's success and longevity.

A key milestone in Okunomatsu's history is its pioneering role in adopting modern brewing techniques. The company was the first sake producer to implement a post-bottling pasteurization method, where bottles are showered with warm water to lock in flavor and freshness [3]. This innovation, alongside their commitment to quality, has led to significant recognition. Okunomatsu consistently wins numerous awards, including gold medals in the National New Sake Tasting Competition, and has been recognized as a top brewery in Fukushima Prefecture for premium sake [1]. Their Okunomatsu Adatara Ginjo has also received international acclaim, including the IWC Champion Sake Award [4].

Today, Okunomatsu continues to be a leader in the industry, blending its deep historical roots with a forward-thinking approach. The brewery maintains its reputation for crafting high-quality sake, including unique products like a special sake that is allowed to drip naturally from cotton bags without pressure, and their "New Age Ginjo" technique, which involves adding ready-made Junmai Ginjo sake to the mash just before pressing [5]. This blend of historical legacy, regional identity, and innovative spirit ensures Okunomatsu's continued prominence in the world of Japanese sake [3].

## Omuraya Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1832 (Tenpo 3)  
**Founder:** Shigubei I, a former soy sauce brewer in Omura, Yaizu, whose name was passed down through the first four generations of the brewery.  
**Location:** Shimada City, Shizuoka Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Uses soft water from the Oi River, sourced from the Southern Alps, and employs traditional 10kg koji boxes for koji production, emphasizing a hands-on approach to brewing. Aims for sake with elegant, refined aromas characteristic of Shizuoka yeast.  

### History

Omuraya Brewing Company, officially Omuraya Shuzojo Co.,LTD, was founded in 1832 (Tenpo 3) by Shigubei I in Shimada City, Shizuoka Prefecture. The brewery is strategically located in Shimada-juku, the 23rd post town on the historic Tokaido Road, which connected Edo (modern-day Tokyo) and Kyoto. The brewery's initial purpose was to produce sake for the discerning travelers and merchants passing through the busy post town, offering a local brew to comfort visitors from Edo. The name 'Omuraya' is derived from the founder's previous occupation as a soy sauce brewer in Omura, Yaizu, before establishing the sake brewery.

Throughout its nearly two-century history, the brewery has faced various challenges, including a crisis that threatened its closure. However, it was sustained by the support of the local community, allowing the tradition to continue under the leadership of the current, seventh-generation owner. A significant milestone in the brewery's modern history occurred in 1975 when they revived the sake "Wakatake Onikoroshi," a brand whose name was found in ancient documents. This revival marked a renewed commitment to their heritage and quality.

The brewery is known for its commitment to quality ingredients and traditional techniques. They utilize the soft, pure underground water of the Oi River, which originates in the Southern Alps and Mt. Akaishi. This soft water contributes to the elegant and gentle aroma and flavor profile of their sake, which is characteristic of Shizuoka yeast. They also emphasize in-house rice milling using the latest equipment to ensure the highest quality of their raw materials.

Omuraya adheres to a philosophy of "putting in the effort and crafting sake with the senses," notably by using traditional 10kg koji boxes for the production of *koji*, a crucial step in the brewing process. In 1980, they released another notable brand, "Onna Nakase" (literally "makes a woman cry"), which has become one of their representative products alongside "Wakatake." The brewery continues to innovate while honoring its historical roots, aiming to craft sake that pairs beautifully with meals and reflects the unique terroir of Shizuoka.

## Ozeki Corporation

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1711  
**Founder:** Osakaya Chobei, founder of the original Manryo brewery in Imazu village, Nada district.  
**Location:** Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture (Nada district)  
**Specialty:** Brewing in the Nada district of Hyogo, utilizing the famous mineral-rich "Miyamizu" water. Also known for pioneering the single-serving "Ozeki One Cup" in 1964.  

### History

Ozeki Corporation, one of Japan's most historically significant sake brewers, was founded in 1711 by Osakaya Chobei in Imazu village, which is part of the Nada district in Hyogo Prefecture. The brewery was originally named "Manryo." The Nada region is renowned for its ideal sake brewing conditions, particularly the availability of "Miyamizu," a mineral-rich water source essential for high-quality sake production. The brewery's early success was built on this foundation, establishing it as a key player in the competitive sake market of the Edo period.

The brewery's name was officially changed to "Ozeki" in 1884, a name that would become synonymous with sake both in Japan and internationally. The term "Ozeki" itself is a rank in professional sumo wrestling, second only to Yokozuna, signifying the company's ambition and high standing in the industry. A major milestone in its modern history occurred in 1964 with the launch of the "Ozeki One Cup," coinciding with the Tokyo Olympics. This innovative product, packaged in a single-serving glass cup, revolutionized the industry by making sake more accessible and convenient, leading to billions of units sold globally.

Ozeki has been a pioneer in the internationalization of sake. In 1979, it became the first Japanese sake producer to establish a brewing presence in the United States, founding Ozeki Sake (U.S.A.), Inc. in Hollister, California. This move was strategic, leveraging the local rice and the clear water from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to produce fresh sake for the American market. The company celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2011, marking three centuries of continuous brewing and innovation.

Today, Ozeki operates with a focus on both traditional methods and modern quality control. Its commitment to the Nada region's brewing heritage, including the use of Miyamizu water and highly polished rice, ensures the quality of its products. The company continues to be a major global sake brewer, known for its wide range of products from traditional premium Daiginjo, named in honor of its founder "Osakaya Chobei," to its popular and accessible "One Cup" line.

## Rihaku Sake Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1882  
**Founder:** Tanaka Takejiro, who established the brewery as a private business in 1882. The brewery was later named by former Prime Minister Reijiro Wakatsuki.  
**Location:** Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Inherits the tradition of the Izumo Toji school of brewing, focusing on a balanced, food-friendly sake style (*shokuchu-shu*). Known for its Junmai Ginjo "Wandering Poet" and Nigori "Dreamy Clouds."  

### History

Rihaku Sake Brewing Company, known locally as Rihaku Shuzo, was founded in 1882 (Meiji 15) in the castle town of Matsue, Shimane Prefecture. The brewery was originally established as a private business by Tanaka Takejiro, though its initial name is not widely publicized. A major milestone occurred in 1928 (Showa 3) when the brewery adopted its current, distinctive name. The name "Rihaku" is the Japanese pronunciation of the celebrated Tang Dynasty Chinese poet, Li Bai (Li Po), who was famous for his love of sake and poetry. This name was personally bestowed upon the brewery by Reijiro Wakatsuki, a native of Matsue who served twice as the Prime Minister of Japan, cementing the brewery's connection to both high culture and political history.

The brewery is situated in the Izumo region of Shimane, an area steeped in Japanese mythology and often cited as the legendary birthplace of sake. This historical and geographical context is central to Rihaku's identity, as the brewery is a proud inheritor of the *Izumo Toji* school of brewing, a traditional and highly respected regional technique. This adherence to local tradition, combined with the region's abundant natural resources, including high-quality water and a climate conducive to sake production, has allowed Rihaku to maintain a consistent and high standard of quality throughout its long history.

Today, Rihaku Shuzo is led by the fifth generation of the founding family, President Yuichiro Tanaka. The brewery's core philosophy centers on producing *shokuchu-shu*, or sake that is perfectly balanced to be enjoyed alongside food. This focus on harmony and versatility has earned their products international acclaim. Notable specialties include the Junmai Ginjo "Wandering Poet" and the Nigori "Dreamy Clouds," both of which have gained significant recognition in global markets. The brewery is particularly successful in exports, with a substantial portion of its production shipped overseas, demonstrating its status as a respected name that successfully blends deep Japanese tradition with modern international appeal.

## Rokka Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1719 (Kyoho era)  
**Founder:** Fujita Kyujiro, a kuramoto (brewery owner) in Hirosaki Castle town  
**Location:** Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing based on the "Aomori Terroir" concept, utilizing local Aomori rice, yeast, koji mold, Mt. Iwaki subsoil water, and Shirakami Sanchi natural lactic acid bacteria, embodying the local "Joppari" (stubborn) spirit.  

### History

Rokka Brewing Company traces its roots back over 300 years to the Edo period, with its oldest predecessor, Takashimaya Shuzo, founded in 1719 (Kyoho 4) by Fujita Kyujiro in the castle town of Hirosaki. Takashimaya Shuzo was a prominent brewery in the region, later joined by two other local sake producers: Shiraume Shuzo, founded in 1886 by Nomura Otojiro, and Kawamura Shuzo-ten, founded in 1909. This collective history of over three centuries forms the deep heritage of the modern company.

The current corporate entity, Rokka Shuzo Co., Ltd., was officially established in March 1972 (Showa 47) through the merger of these three venerable Hirosaki breweries: Takashimaya Shuzo, Shiraume Shuzo, and Kawamura Shuzo-ten. The merger was a strategic move to consolidate production facilities and enhance competitiveness against larger national sake manufacturers. The name "Rokka" (六花), meaning "six flowers," is an elegant reference to the beautiful, pure snowflakes that dance in the region, symbolizing the purity of their sake. For decades, the brewery was best known for its flagship brand, *Joppari* (じょっぱり), a term in the local Tsugaru dialect meaning "stubborn person," which reflects the tenacious spirit of the local people and the brewery's commitment to quality.

A major turning point in the brewery's modern history occurred in August 2023 when Rokka Shuzo relocated its main brewing facility from the city center to a new, state-of-the-art location at the foothills of the sacred Mt. Iwaki. This significant move was driven by the pursuit of an ideal brewing environment, specifically to secure access to the high-quality subsoil water of Mt. Iwaki and the natural environment near the Iwaki River and the Shirakami Sanchi World Heritage Site. The relocation marked a renewed commitment to the concept of "Aomori Terroir," aiming to create sake that is entirely "Made-in-Aomori."

The new era is defined by the launch of the brand *Torai* (杜來), which embodies the culmination of the brewery's 300-year history, the wisdom of its master brewers (*tōji*), and the passion of its staff. This brand is the realization of a long-held dream to use only local Aomori ingredients, including local rice, yeast, koji mold, Mt. Iwaki water, and even natural lactic acid bacteria from the Shirakami Sanchi. Rokka Shuzo has also achieved significant recognition, earning multiple IWC Gold Medals and Gold Medals at the National New Sake Appraisal, solidifying its status as a leading brewery in the Tohoku region.

## Saura Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1724  
**Founder:** Tomi-emon Saura (尾島屋富右衛門), who initially ran a koji manufacturing business before founding the brewery in 1724 after inheriting brewing shares.  
**Location:** Shiogama City, Miyagi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing "classic and elegant" sake with a focus on umami and a mild mouth-feel, using local Miyagi rice (Manamusume), and utilizing their proprietary Urakasumi yeast (Kyokai No. 12). The brewery has a long-standing tradition of dedicating sacred sake to Shiogama Shrine.  

### History

Saura Co., Ltd., the brewer of the renowned Urakasumi sake, was founded in 1724 (Kyoho 9) in the historic port town of Shiogama, Miyagi Prefecture. The founder, Tomi-emon Saura (Ojimaya Tomiemon), was the second son of the Sato family who was adopted into the Miuraya family. He initially operated a koji (malted rice) manufacturing business before acquiring brewing shares and establishing the brewery. The brewery's location in Shiogama, a city with a long history and scenic beauty, is referenced in the brand name Urakasumi, which means "Misty Bay" and is a poetic nod to the local landscape.

The brewery's historical significance was cemented in the 19th century when it was designated to provide sacred sake to the revered Shiogama Shrine, the Mutsu Province's highest-ranking shrine. This long-standing connection elevated the brewery's status and instilled a deep commitment to quality. A major milestone in the brewery's history was the development of the distinctive "Hirano" style of brewing, pioneered by the legendary Nambu Sake Brewing Guild master brewer (*Toji*) Sagoro Hirano and his nephew Juichi Hirano in the 1940s and 1950s. This award-winning technique became the foundation for Urakasumi's elegant and classic sake profile.

The commitment to quality continued with the registration of their house yeast as Kyokai No. 12 by the Brewing Society of Japan in 1986, a testament to their technical excellence. Today, the brewery is managed by the 13th-generation Saura family president, Koichi Saura, and continues to pursue the highest quality. In addition to the historic main brewery, Urakasumi operates a modern facility in Higashi-Matsushima city, ensuring the continuation of its 300-year legacy while also pioneering the internationalization of sake.

## Sawanotsuru Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1717  
**Founder:** Shodai Kihee, the first-generation owner of a rice shop  
**Location:** Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Primary focus on Junmai-shu (pure rice sake), leveraging the founder's background as a rice merchant. The brewery also employs the traditional Kimoto brewing method for certain products. The company's logo, '※', is a stylized representation of the Japanese character for rice (米).  

### History

The Sawanotsuru Co., Ltd. brewery, one of Japan's largest sake producers, was established in 1717 (Kyoho 2nd year) in the Nishigo district of Nada-ku, Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture. The brewery's origins trace back to its founder, Shodai Kihee (初代喜兵衛), the first-generation owner of a successful rice shop, who began sake brewing as a side business. This foundation as a rice merchant instilled a deep and enduring commitment to the quality of rice, a legacy that continues to define the brewery's philosophy. This commitment is symbolically represented by the company's unique mark, "※," which is derived from the Japanese character for "rice" (米). The brewery's location in Nada-gogo, a region renowned for its ideal conditions—including the mineral-rich Miyamizu water and the cold Rokko-oroshi winds—further cemented its reputation for producing high-quality sake.

Throughout its long history, Sawanotsuru has maintained a steadfast focus on Junmai-shu (pure rice sake), which is brewed only with rice, koji, and water. The company has leveraged the rice connoisseurship inherited from its founding generation to specialize in this category, becoming a leader in Junmai-shu production and sales. While embracing modern techniques, Sawanotsuru also honors tradition by utilizing labor-intensive methods such as the Kimoto brewing process for select products, which results in a sake with deep richness and complexity. This balance of tradition and innovation has allowed the brewery to create a diverse portfolio, including modern, easy-to-drink, low-alcohol Junmai-shu, which has helped introduce sake to younger generations and a global audience.

A significant cultural milestone for the brewery was the opening of the Sawanotsuru Museum in November 1978. Housed in a renovated old brewery (Oishi Kura) that dates back over 170 years to the late Edo period, the museum serves to disseminate the culture of sake brewing and preserve valuable historical tools. In 2017, Sawanotsuru celebrated its 300th anniversary, a testament to its resilience and enduring quality. The brewery remains a family-owned enterprise, currently led by Takashi Nishimura, the 15th-generation head of the family, who continues to guide the company with a vision for the next century of sake production.

## Sekiya Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1864 (Genji 1)  
**Founder:** Buzaemon Sekiya, adopted into the Sekiya family of shōya (village headmen) in Taguchi Village  
**Location:** Shitara-cho, Aichi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** "Wajoryoshu" philosophy; proactive modernization of brewing processes; "from rice field to the glass" approach, including engaging in agriculture; focus on Ginjo sake production  

### History

Sekiya Brewing Company was founded in 1864 (Genji 1), during the tumultuous final years of the Edo period, in Taguchi Village, which is now Shitara-cho, Aichi Prefecture, in the rich natural environment of the Okumikawa region. The founder, Buzaemon Sekiya, was adopted into the local Sekiya family, who held the respected position of *shōya* (village headmen). He established the brewery after separating from the main family, laying the foundation for a business that would span over a century and a half. The company demonstrated early resilience, notably navigating the economic challenges of the Great Depression, which led to its formal reorganization as the Sekiya Brewing Partnership Company in December 1930.

The brewery operates under the guiding philosophy of "Wajoryoshu" (和醸良酒), meaning "beautiful sake created by the harmony of people." This principle has driven the company's unique approach to brewing, which emphasizes a balance between tradition and proactive modernization. Sekiya has been a pioneer in adopting modern machinery to rationalize labor-intensive processes, allowing brewers to focus on the intricate details of sake production and the transmission of traditional skills to future generations. This forward-thinking approach is coupled with a commitment to the entire process, from "rice field to the glass," including engaging in agriculture to ensure the quality of their raw materials.

A major milestone in the company's modern era was the opening of the Ginjo Kobo (Inabu Factory) in Toyota-shi in April 2004, a facility dedicated to the production of high-quality *Ginjo* sake. This focus on premium brewing has been recognized with multiple accolades, including Gold Prizes at the prestigious National New Sake Appraisal in 1989 and 1997. Beyond production, Sekiya has actively promoted sake culture and engagement with the public, opening SAKE BAR MARUTANI in 2013, Koji MARUTANI in 2020, and the Houraisen Sake Lab in 2021. These ventures reflect the company's commitment to its three pillars of business activity: brewing, agriculture, and the suggestion of nourishment, all aimed at contributing to the community and cultivating the future of Japanese sake.

## Senkin Shuzō

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1806  
**Founder:** Unknown (The Usui family are the 11th generation of owners)  
**Location:** Sakura City, Tochigi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** The "Domaine Senkin" concept, which involves using the same local water source for both rice cultivation and brewing. They are known for their high-acidity, sweet-tart sake (SMV -2 to -3, Acidity 2.0-2.3) designed to pair with Western cuisine, and their "Supernatural sake" brewed with wild yeast and ancient Kamenoo rice.  

### History

Senkin Shuzō, one of the oldest breweries in Tochigi Prefecture, was established in 1806 (Culture 3 in the Edo period) in what is now Sakura City. The brewery was strategically built along the old Ōshu Kaidō, one of the five major routes of the Edo period, which facilitated its early growth and distribution. For centuries, the brewery was a quiet, traditional operation, passed down through the Usui family, focusing on local sake production. The name "Senkin" itself is derived from the image of a crane, a sacred bird associated with hermits and longevity, symbolizing the brewery's deep roots and traditional heritage.

Despite its long history, the brewery faced a severe crisis in the early 21st century. For a period, Senkin had relied on producing cheap, mass-market sake for a major manufacturer, a strategy that provided stability but compromised its identity. When this manufacturer abruptly terminated the contract, the 200-year-old business was left on the brink of collapse. This financial and existential threat forced the Usui family to liquidate the old company and restart under new management in 2008, marking a critical turning point in the brewery's history.

The revival was spearheaded by the 11th-generation brothers, Usui Kazuki and Usui Masato. Kazuki, the elder brother and new CEO, brought an unconventional background to the sake world, having trained and worked as a sommelier in the wine industry. His younger brother, Masato, took on the role of Tōji (brewmaster). Together, they abandoned the mass-production model and committed to transforming Senkin into an artisanal brewery focused exclusively on small-batch, premium sake. This radical shift was a "Hail Mary pass," a desperate and daring bid to save the family business.

The brothers' innovation centered on a philosophy of "new meets old," challenging conventional sake wisdom. Kazuki, drawing on his sommelier experience, developed a new style of sake with high acidity and sweetness, a profile previously associated with spoilage. This sweet-tart flavor, comparable to a German Riesling, was designed to complement Western cuisine and appeal to a younger, more cosmopolitan demographic. Initially met with derision by older experts, this style proved wildly popular with young women and wine lovers, expanding sake's market.

Today, Senkin operates under the concept of "Domaine Senkin," emphasizing a deep connection to its terroir. This includes using the same underground water vein for both cultivating their sake rice (Kamenoo, Yamadanishiki, and Omachi) and for brewing. Furthermore, they have embraced a philosophy of "Nature," reviving ancient techniques such as using the wild, natural yeast present in the brewery environment and working with the ancient Kamenoo rice strain to create their "Supernatural sake," ensuring the brewery's future is rooted in its past.

## Shiraiwa K. K.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 2019  
**Founder:** Richard Geoffroy, former fifth-generation chef de cave of Dom Pérignon Champagne  
**Location:** Tateyama Town, Toyama Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering the use of 'assemblage' (blending of multiple rice varieties, yeast strains, and batches) in sake brewing, a technique borrowed from Champagne. The brewery building was designed by architect Kengo Kuma.  

### History

Shiraiwa K. K. is a modern sake brewery founded in 2019 by Richard Geoffroy, the highly acclaimed former fifth-generation chef de cave of Dom Pérignon Champagne. Geoffroy, who had a long-standing appreciation for Japan and its culture, retired from his 28-year tenure at the legendary Champagne house to embark on a new project: creating a sake that could stand as a "true international sake" and engage in a dialogue with the world. The brewery is located in Tateyama Town, Toyama Prefecture, a region chosen for its stunning landscape, proximity to Mount Tate, and the progressive spirit of Toyama City.

The project was a collaborative effort from its inception. Geoffroy partnered with Ryuichiro Masuda, CEO of the established Toyama-based brewery Masuda Shuzo, for the initial production and development of the IWA 5 brand. A major milestone was the completion of the brewery's own facility, the *kura* named Shiraiwa, in the fall of 2021. This facility is a significant piece of modern architectural design, created by the renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, and is designed to embody the core principles of inclusivity and community, with production and reception areas sharing the same roof.

The brewery's primary cultural and technical significance lies in its unique brewing philosophy centered on **assemblage**, or blending, a technique Geoffroy mastered in Champagne. Instead of focusing on a single *shuzo kotekimai* (sake rice) or a single yeast strain, Shiraiwa K. K. blends multiple rice varieties, yeast strains, and brewing batches to achieve a complex, balanced, and consistent final product, branded as IWA 5. This approach is considered pioneering in the sake world, where single-batch purity is often the tradition. The current brewmaster, Masato Yabuta, who specializes in traditional *yamahai* and *kimoto* styles, works with Geoffroy to execute this innovative blending process.

Shiraiwa K. K. represents a bold fusion of French winemaking expertise and Japanese brewing tradition. The brewery's dedication to quality, innovation, and a global perspective has quickly established IWA 5 as a premium, highly sought-after sake. The brewery continues to release new "Assemblages" of IWA 5, each a unique blend that reflects the ongoing pursuit of a sake ready for a global stage.

## Shirakabegura

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 2001  
**Founder:** Yomo family (parent company founder, 1842); Usaburo Yomo (first president of Takara Shuzo, 1925)  
**Location:** Nada, Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Mastery of the traditional Kimoto brewing style; production of Muroka Genshu (unfiltered, undiluted sake); harmonization of new technology with traditional hand-brewing techniques; use of Miyamizu water; production of MIO Sparkling Sake.  

### History

The history of Shirakabegura is intrinsically linked to its parent company, the Takara Group, which traces its origins back to 1842, toward the end of Japan's Edo period. The Yomo family founded the original enterprise in the Fushimi district of Kyoto, initially brewing sake before expanding into shochu, mirin, and shirozake by 1864 [1]. This long-standing heritage in brewing provides the foundation for the modern brewery. The company was formally incorporated as Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. in 1925, with Usaburo Yomo as its first president, who, alongside Kurakichi Ohmiya, worked to expand the company's reach across Japan [1].

The Shirakabegura brewery itself represents a major modern milestone for the Takara Group. It was established in November 2001 in the Nada district of Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, one of Japan's most revered sake-producing regions [2] [3]. The facility is a striking six-story structure, considered one of the most advanced in the industry, built to harmonize two contrasting philosophies: the use of cutting-edge technology to precisely mimic traditional hand-brewing techniques, and the preservation of the human art, judgment, and intuition passed down through generations of toji (master brewers) [4].

Shirakabegura quickly established a reputation for excellence, particularly in the production of premium sake. The brewery has achieved one of the longest gold medal streaks in the prestigious Annual Japan Sake Awards, a testament to its consistent quality and innovative approach [4]. This commitment to both tradition and modernity is evident in its diverse product range, which includes traditional styles like Kimoto and Muroka Genshu, as well as the globally popular MIO Sparkling Sake, which has introduced a new generation of consumers to the world of sake [4].

Today, Shirakabegura continues to operate as a center of innovation and tradition within the Takara Group. Its strategic location in Nada allows it to utilize the region's famous Miyamizu water, a hard water uniquely suited for sake production, ensuring the distinct character of its brews [4]. The brewery's ongoing success is a reflection of its philosophy to draw out the natural flavor of rice while maintaining the highest standards of modern production, solidifying its place as a key player in the global sake market.

## Shirataki Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1855 (Ansei 2 era)  
**Founder:** Minatoya Tosuke, an innkeeper on the historic road connecting Echigo (Niigata) to Edo (Tokyo)  
**Location:** Yuzawa-cho, Niigata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing with pristine, 50-year-old meltwater from the Japanese Alps and a philosophy of continuous evolution, exemplified by the Jozen Mizuno Gotoshi brand, which means "to flow like water." The brewery also pioneered a modern, refreshing sake style and switched to Junmai-only production in 2009.  

### History

Shirataki Brewing Company was established in 1855 (Ansei 2 era) by Minatoya Tosuke in Echigo Yuzawa, an area now known as Yuzawa-cho in Niigata Prefecture. The location, nestled in the heart of the Japanese Alps, was strategically important, lying on a historic road that connected the Echigo region to Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Tosuke, an innkeeper, founded the brewery with the dream of using the area's pristine meltwater to produce sake. The initial purpose of the sake was to refresh and heal the fatigue of the countless travelers who passed through the town, which was famous for its natural hot springs and ski resorts. The brewery's core resource remains the abundant, high-quality water, which originates from up to 15 meters of snow that melts slowly into the earth, emerging as minerally charged, impurity-free groundwater 40-50 years later.

The brewery's modern history is defined by the launch of its flagship brand, *Jozen Mizuno Gotoshi*, in September 1990. This brand was a revolutionary product that coincided with a local brewery boom in Niigata, spurred by the new accessibility provided by the Joetsu Bullet Train and a skiing fad. *Jozen Mizuno Gotoshi* broke industry taboos with its sky-blue transparent bottle, distinctive digital typeface, and a pure, refreshing flavor that appealed to a new generation of sake drinkers. The brand was a smash hit, with production levels tripling at the peak of its popularity, which occurred around 1997.

Following the peak, the local brewery bubble burst, and sales entered a rapid decline. In the midst of this challenge, Shintaro Takahashi, the seventh-generation president, took the reins at the age of 28. To reinvent the company, he introduced bold innovations, including a major change in 2009 to switch the flagship *Jozen Mizuno Gotoshi* from a Ginjo (containing brewer's alcohol) to a Junmai Ginjo, committing the brewery to exclusively producing Junmai sake. This move was coupled with a new focus on exports, which now account for approximately 10% of the company's turnover, particularly in the Asian market.

Shirataki's philosophy is rooted in the meaning of its flagship brand's name, *Jozen Mizuno Gotoshi*, which translates to "to flow like water." This concept represents extreme flexibility and a commitment to continuous evolution, balancing traditional values with experimental intentions. The brewery aims to occupy a middle layer between small craft breweries and nationwide big brands, maintaining high quality while providing a stable and readily available product. This forward-looking approach, combined with the use of local Uonuma Koshihikari rice and the region's exceptional meltwater, continues to drive the brewery's success.

## Suigei Brewing Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1872  
**Founder:** Unknown (Predecessor was Ishino Brewery, which evolved from a general store named "Aburaya Chosuke")  
**Location:** Kochi City, Kochi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing "food sake" (shokuchu-shu) with a moderate aroma, distinct umami, and a sharp, clean aftertaste, often described as "rich and dry" (hōjun karakuchi). The brewery also specializes in high-end Junmai Daiginjo production at its modern Tosa-gura facility.  

### History

The history of Suigei Brewing Co., Ltd. is rooted in the Edo Period, beginning as a general store named "Aburaya Chosuke" in Kochi Prefecture [1]. The direct predecessor to the modern company, Ishino Brewery, was founded in 1872 in Nagahama, Kochi City, and began brewing sake [1]. This founding year of 1872 is consistently cited as the origin of the brewery's sake-making tradition [2] [3].

A significant reorganization occurred in 1969, when the operation was reformed into Suigei Brewing LLC, and the company began producing and selling sake under the "Suigei" brand, with the goal of providing high-quality sake throughout Kochi Prefecture [1]. The name "Suigei," meaning "Drunken Whale," is a tribute to the feudal lord of the Tosa Domain, Yamauchi Yodo, who was nicknamed "the drunken lord of the sea with whales" due to his deep love for sake [3] [4]. The company was formally reorganized into Suigei Brewing Co., Ltd. in 1972, expanding its aim to provide high-quality sake throughout the entire Shikoku region [1].

A major turning point came in 1985 when the brewery invited Kyoji Doi, an Akitsu-style Toji (master brewer), and began producing ginjo-style sake [1]. This focus on premium sake led to the release of the representative product, Junmai Ginjo "Ginrei," in 1987, which helped expand the market nationwide [1]. The original Nagahama-gura facility was renovated in 1993 to expand production capacity [1]. In 2013, Brewmaster Doi retired, and his apprentice, Seiji Matsumoto, was appointed as the new brewmaster [1].

The brewery entered a new era of expansion and specialization in 2018 with the completion of the state-of-the-art "Tosa-gura" facility in Tosa City, Kochi Prefecture [1] [3]. This new facility is dedicated to ginjo sake production, focusing on the luxury line, the HIGH-END COLLECTION, including the flagship Junmai Daiginjo DAITO series launched in 2017 [1]. The company now operates two brewing facilities, Tosa-gura and Nagahama-gura, combining historical tradition with modern technology to pursue its mission of creating the best "food sake" for the world's tables [1] [2].

## TATENOKAWA, Inc.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1832  
**Founder:** Heishiro (first generation), a local figure who began brewing after being recommended by a retainer of the Uesugi clan.  
**Location:** Sakata City, Yamagata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Exclusive focus on brewing only Junmai Daiginjo sake since 2010, including the ultra-premium "Tatenokawa 18" which is polished to 18% of the original grain size.  

### History

The history of TATENOKAWA, Inc. dates back to 1832, during the late Edo period, when the brewery was first established in the Shonai region of Yamagata Prefecture. The impetus for its founding came from a retainer of the Uesugi clan, who, upon visiting the area, was so impressed by the exceptional quality of the local water that he recommended sake production to a local figure known as Heishiro. Following this recommendation, Heishiro officially began the process of sake making in 1854.

A significant milestone in the brewery's early history occurred in 1855. The visiting Daimyo of the Shonai Clan, Sakai Tadakatsu, was presented with the newly produced sake. In recognition of its quality, the Daimyo personally christened the brand "TATENOKAWA," which translates to "Castle Brook." This name has been carried forward through the generations, symbolizing the brewery's deep roots in the local history and its connection to the region's feudal past. The brewery has been continuously managed by the founding family, with Sato Jumpei currently serving as the 6th generation brewer and CEO.

In the modern era, Tatenokawa made a bold and pioneering decision that redefined its identity. In 2010, the company became the first brewery in Yamagata Prefecture—a region renowned as the "Ginjo Kingdom"—to commit to exclusively brewing Junmai Daiginjo-grade sake. This strategic focus on the highest quality category of sake reflects a dedication to constant improvement and a commitment to producing only the finest products. This philosophy is further exemplified by their ultra-premium "Tatenokawa 18," a sake made from rice polished down to an astonishing 18% of its original size, pushing the boundaries of traditional brewing techniques.

## Takagi Brewing Company (Takagi Shuzo)

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1615  
**Founder:** Unknown, from a family of high-ranking officials and aristocrats; the hereditary name "Tatsugoro" has been passed down through the generations  
**Location:** Murayama City, Yamagata Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Proprietary sake rice variety Ryū no Otoshigo (Sea Dragon's Child); use of the meticulous "Shichitare Nijukkan" method, where sake is gently extracted by allowing it to drip naturally from suspended cloth bags; and the creation of the cult-status Juyondai brand.  

### History

Takagi Brewing Company, or Takagi Shuzo, is a historic sake brewery located in Murayama City, Yamagata Prefecture, with a lineage that spans over four centuries [1] [2]. The brewery was established in 1615, during the early Edo period, making it one of the oldest sake producers in Japan [3]. The Takagi family traces its roots back to high-ranking officials and aristocrats, and the hereditary name "Tatsugoro" has been passed down through the generations of family heads [2] [4]. For much of its history, the brewery was a respected but relatively obscure local producer, with its sakes sold under the brand name Kuronawa [5].

The brewery's major turning point and rise to international fame occurred in the 1990s with the introduction of the **Juyondai** (十四代) brand [5]. In 1993, Akitsuna Takagi, the 15th-generation owner, took over the brewery at the age of 25 and, with the departure of the master brewer, began brewing himself [5] [6]. He created the Juyondai brand, which translates to "Fourteenth Generation," to honor his father, the 14th-generation head, Tatsugoro Takagi [7]. Akitsuna Takagi's vision was to create a sake that was fruity, sweet, and complex, a stark contrast to the clean and dry Niigata-style sakes that were popular at the time [5]. This innovative flavor profile quickly gained a cult following and is credited with changing the landscape of premium sake in Japan [5].

Takagi Shuzo is known for its meticulous and proprietary brewing techniques, which contribute to the unique quality of its sake. The brewery developed its own proprietary sake rice variety called **Ryū no Otoshigo** (龍の落とし子), or "Sea Dragon's Child," which is used in some of its most premium offerings [8] [9]. Furthermore, the brewery employs the highly specialized **"Shichitare Nijukkan"** method for its top-tier Junmai Daiginjo sakes [10]. This technique involves gently extracting the sake by allowing it to drip naturally from suspended cloth bags, a process that captures only the purest and most delicate essence of the brew [10].

The Juyondai brand's success has been amplified by a deliberate strategy of scarcity and mystique, which has cemented its status as a highly sought-after, premium product globally [5]. The brewery is famously secretive, maintaining no public website and communicating only by fax, which further contributes to its legendary status [5]. The brewery continues to operate in Murayama City, Yamagata, with the 15th-generation head, Akitsuna Takagi, having inherited the hereditary name Tatsugoro Takagi (XV) in 2023 following his father's passing [2]. The brewery's history is a testament to a successful blend of centuries-old tradition and modern, market-defining innovation.

## Tamanohikari Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1673 (Enpo era)  
**Founder:** Nakaya Rokuzaemon, who established the business under a license from Tokugawa Mitsusada, the second lord of the Kii Domain  
**Location:** Fushimi Ku, Kyoto Shi, Kyoto Fu  
**Specialty:** Junmai-only brewing, having led the industry in reviving the pure sake style in 1964. The brewery uses premium sake rice like Bizen Omachi and Yamada Nishiki, and the famous Fushimi water from Momoyama Hills.  

### History

Tamanohikari Brewing Company was founded in 1673 (the first year of the Enpo era) by Nakaya Rokuzaemon, who established the business in Yoriyamachi, Wakayama Prefecture, under a license granted by Tokugawa Mitsusada, the second lord of the Kii Domain. This founding marks the beginning of a centuries-long tradition of sake brewing. The brewery later relocated to the Fushimi district of Kyoto, a region renowned for its exceptional water quality, particularly the soft, pure groundwater from the Momoyama Hills. This water source is historically significant, having been used by the legendary warrior Toyotomi Hideyoshi for his tea ceremonies centuries ago, and is now recognized by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment as one of the country’s 100 finest waters.

The brewery's most significant historical milestone and cultural contribution came in 1964 when Tamanohikari led the industry in reviving the production of *junmai* sake. For decades, the practice of adding distilled alcohol and sugar to sake had become the mainstream, initially due to rice shortages during World War II and later to increase profits. Tamanohikari made the bold and costly decision to return to the pure, traditional method of brewing sake using only rice, water, and *koji*. This pioneering move was a major risk, as *junmai* requires up to 1.8 times the amount of rice and was not widely appreciated at the time, but it solidified the brewery's commitment to the true flavor of sake.

Today, Tamanohikari maintains its strict *junmai*-only philosophy, focusing exclusively on *junmai ginjo* and *junmai daiginjo* grades. Their dedication extends to the meticulous selection and cultivation of premium sake rice, including the highly-regarded Bizen Omachi, Yamada Nishiki, and local Kyoto Iwai varieties. Furthermore, the brewery emphasizes traditional craftsmanship, with the crucial *koji* making process being entirely done by hand, relying on the intuition and experience of the *toji* (chief brewers). This centuries-old commitment to purity and quality has established Tamanohikari as a distinguished and influential name in the world of premium sake.

## Tentaka Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1914  
**Founder:** Motoichi Ozaki, a liquor wholesaler who bought a failing brewery in Yuzukami and named it after a dream of a hawk soaring toward the heavens.  
**Location:** Otawara City, Tochigi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Pioneering organic sake production (certified in Japan, US, and Europe since 2005), and a long-standing tradition of brewing dry sake under the motto "If it isn't dry, it isn't sake."  

### History

Tentaka Brewing Company was founded in 1914 in Yuzukami, Otawara City, Tochigi Prefecture, by Motoichi Ozaki, a liquor wholesaler. The brewery's name, "Tentaka" (Hawk in the Heavens), was inspired by a dream Ozaki had on a trip to Kyoto, symbolizing a powerful and soaring vision. From its inception, the brewery adopted the founder's strict philosophy: "If it isn't dry, it isn't sake," establishing a long-standing tradition of crafting crisp, dry sake that remains a core characteristic of their products today. The brewery is situated in a naturally rich area, benefiting from clean air and water sourced from an underground stream originating in the Yamizo and Nasu mountain ranges.

The brewery has been a family-run operation, with the founder's son and grandson continuing the tradition. The current president, Munenori Ozaki, the third-generation *kuramoto*, has overseen a significant evolution in the brewery's focus, particularly in the realm of environmental sustainability and organic production. In the mid-1990s, the brewery began a local initiative called the Medaka-Kai to study and promote the local community through sake. This focus on the environment culminated in a major milestone in 2005 when Tentaka became one of the first sake breweries to receive organic certification in Japan, following the establishment of the JAS Act.

Tentaka's commitment to organic brewing is comprehensive, extending beyond the use of organic rice—some of which is grown at their own "Tentaka Organic Farm"—to include sustainable practices within the facility itself, such as using solar panels for 30% of their electricity and recycling warm water from the rice steaming process to heat the building. This dedication has led to significant recognition, including their "Organic Junmai Daiginjo Tentaka" winning a Gold Medal at the Annual Japan Sake Awards in 2017, a first for an organic *nihonshu*. As of 2024, their organic sake has won this prestigious award four times, solidifying their position as a pioneer in the organic sake movement.

The brewery continues to balance its traditional focus on dry, food-friendly sake with modern environmental consciousness. Under the guidance of their Toji (Master Brewer), Mr. Kouetsu Sugumachi of the Nanbu school, Tentaka maintains a high standard of precision and quality. The brewery intentionally limits its production volume to ensure quality control, with a significant portion of its sake sold locally in Tochigi Prefecture, reinforcing its deep connection to the regional community and its natural environment.

## Tenzan Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1875  
**Founder:** Toshizo Shichida and his wife, Tsuki, who converted their milling and noodle business into a sake brewery.  
**Location:** Iwakura, Ogi-machi, Ogi, Saga Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing with the pure, medium-hard water from the Gion River and Kiyomizu waterfall (one of Japan's 100 most exquisite waters), and a focus on rice cultivation through the "Tenzan Sake Rice Cultivation Study Group." Also notable for early adoption of Junmai sake and development of sparkling sake.  

### History

The history of Tenzan Brewing Company, or Tenzan Shuzo, is rooted in a water milling and noodle business established in 1861 in Iwakura, Ogi-machi, Saga Prefecture, on the banks of the Gion River [1] [2]. The Shichida family, who owned the business, used the clear stream of water from the river, which is ideal for sake brewing, and provided rice polishing services for local sake brewers [1]. The official transition to sake brewing occurred in 1875 when Toshizo Shichida and his wife, Tsuki, purchased the equipment and premises of a failing local brewery, establishing themselves as the first Kuramoto (brewery owner) [1] [2].

The brewery's early history is marked by the vision of its second Kuramoto, Hideichi Shichida, who in 1936 established the general partnership, Shichida Honten [1] [2]. Hideichi was a man of diverse talents, known for his knowledge of architecture. He not only built the brewery but also contributed to the local community by constructing temples and schools [1]. His architectural legacy is preserved in the brewery's Meiji, Taisho, and Showa cellars, along with the vertical water wheel and its channels, which have been designated as Registered National Tangible Cultural Properties and Saga Prefectural Heritage items [2]. The third Kuramoto, also named Hideichi Shichida, reorganized the company as Tenzan Sake Brewery, Inc. in 1959 and focused on agricultural innovation, even establishing an agricultural university to aid in post-WWII regional restoration [1].

The brewery has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach to sake production. The fourth Kuramoto, Tadao Shichida, modernized the bottling process and was an early advocate for **Junmai sake** (additive-free sake), actively promoting it as a member of the Japan Junmaishu Association [1] [2]. This commitment to quality and innovation continued with the fifth Kuramoto, Toshihide Shichida, who emphasized the philosophy that "Brewing starts from the rice," leading to the establishment of the "Tenzan Sake Rice Cultivation Study Group" with contracted farmers [1] [2].

The current, sixth Kuramoto, Kensuke Shichida, continues this tradition of quality improvement and challenge. In 2015, he introduced an Italian monoblock filling machine to prevent oxidation by injecting nitrogen gas during bottling, a significant step in modern quality control [1]. Furthermore, he has been a key figure in the development of world-class sparkling sake, serving as a director in the Japan Awasake Association [1]. The brewery's main brand, "Tenzan," is named after the nearby Mt. Tenzan, and their commitment to using the pure, medium-hard water from the Gion River and Kiyomizu waterfall—selected as one of the 100 most exquisite waters in Japan—remains central to their brewing identity [2].

## Toshimaya Honten

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1596  
**Founder:** Toshimaya Juemon, opened the original sake store and tavern  
**Location:** Higashi-Murayama City, Tokyo Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Original creator of *shirozake* (white sake), a sweet rice liqueur. Their premium sake brand, *Kinkon*, is used as the sacred sake at Meiji Jingu Shrine and Kanda Myojin Shrine.  

### History

Toshimaya Honten traces its origins back to **1596** (Keicho 1), making it one of the oldest establishments in Tokyo. The founder, **Toshimaya Juemon**, opened a sake store and tavern (*izakaya*) at the Kamakura Waterfront in central Edo (present-day Kanda). This establishment is historically significant, as it is often credited with opening the first tavern in Japan. Juemon quickly gained fame for brewing and selling *shirozake* (white sake), a sweet rice liqueur that became highly popular, especially among women. The shop also sold *Kudari-zake* (sake transported from the Kansai region) at low prices, paired with cheap *Dengaku* (grilled tofu), establishing a bustling social hub and a unique business model that included trading with the Tokugawa Shogunate.

For centuries, Toshimaya operated primarily as a sake retailer and *shirozake* producer. The company officially began its sake brewing business in the middle of the Meiji era (1868-1912) under the 12th company president, Masajiro Yoshimura. The initial brewery was established in the famous Nada region of Hyogo Prefecture. However, at the beginning of the Showa era (1926-1989), Yoshimura moved the brewing operations to **Higashi-Murayama City** in west Tokyo, where the Toshimaya Shuzou brewery remains today. This move solidified their commitment to the Tokyo region.

The company's history in central Tokyo is marked by resilience in the face of disaster. The original building was destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and subsequently rebuilt. It suffered a second tragedy when the premises were burned down during the Great Tokyo Air Raid on March 10, 1945. After the war, the company was forced to relocate its main shop to its current location in Sarugaku-cho, Kanda, due to the original site being taken over by Allied occupation forces.

Today, Toshimaya Honten continues its legacy as a Tokyo institution. Its premium sake brand, **Kinkon** (Golden Wedding Anniversary), has achieved notable success, winning numerous gold prizes at the Annual Japan Sake Awards. Furthermore, Kinkon is designated as the sacred sake (*omiki*) for two of Tokyo's most important shrines: the Meiji Jingu Shrine and the Kanda Myojin Shrine, underscoring the brewery's deep cultural heritage and status in the capital. The company also maintains a significant role in the food industry, dealing in essential ingredients like soy sauce and mirin.

## Tsuji Honten

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1804  
**Founder:** Yahei Tsuji, originally a mercer (merchant) who ventured into the brewing business  
**Location:** Katsuyama, Okayama Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Revival of the ancient Bodaimoto brewing method and pioneering use of local Omachi sake rice, led by Okayama's first female master brewer, Maiko Tsuji.  

### History

Tsuji Honten, operating under the main brand Gozenshu, was established in 1804 in Katsuyama, Okayama Prefecture, by Yahei Tsuji, a local mercer who transitioned into sake brewing. The brewery's original brand was "Man Etsu" (萬悦), but it was later renamed "Gozenshu" after the sake was presented to and favored by the local feudal lord, the Miura clan, during the late Edo period. The brewery is situated in the Mimasaka region, historically known as "Umasake no Kuni" (the country of fine brew), benefiting from the area's chilly climate, fine groundwater from the Asahi River, and quality sake-rice.

The brewery has long been a pioneer in the industry, notably embracing the production of *junmai* sake—pure rice sake—for over four decades, well before the recent surge in its popularity. This commitment to purity and quality is reflected in their long-standing motto: "Being responsible for making the finest sake with locally-sourced rice, water and true local craftsmanship." In the modern era, Tsuji Honten has been revitalized under the leadership of Maiko Tsuji, the 7th-generation family head and Okayama's first female master brewer, who took the helm in 2007, continuing the legacy of her mentor, Takumi Harada.

A key specialty of Tsuji Honten is the revival and mastery of the ancient *Bodaimoto* brewing method, a 600-year-old technique that promotes natural lactic acid fermentation, resulting in rich, complex, and rustic sake. Furthermore, the brewery is a champion of local ingredients, pioneering the use of Okayama's heirloom *Omachi* sake rice. For over 25 years, they have partnered with the Setocho Omachi Bukai (a local farmers' study group) to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality Omachi rice, which is a central component of their signature "Gozenshu 1859" line.

Beyond its brewing achievements, the Tsuji family has a rich cultural heritage, actively engaging with the arts during the Meiji and Showa periods. The brewery hosted numerous famous artists and writers, including the poets Tekkan and Akiko Yosano. The literary giant Junichiro Tanizaki, a sake enthusiast, even wrote his major novel *The Makioka Sisters* while evacuated in Katsuyama during World War II. In recognition of its historical and architectural significance, the brewery's main building, which preserves the traditional town-house construction, was registered as a Tangible Cultural Property in November 2013, solidifying its place in the town's historical landscape.

## Tsukasabotan Brewing Company

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1603 (Keichō era)  
**Founder:** Shigeyoshi Fukao, chief retainer to the Tosa daimyo Yamauchi Kazutoyo, who commissioned the original sake shop. The actual founder was the unnamed "御酒屋" (Goshuya) merchant who accompanied him.  
**Location:** Sakawa Town, Takaoka District, Kochi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Brewing classic, clean, and extra-dry sake that embodies the "Tosa spirit," with their flagship brand "Senchu Hassaku" being a prime example. They also specialize in low-alcohol Yuzushu made with local mountain yuzu (yama yuzu) [1] [4].  

### History

The history of Tsukasabotan Brewing Company begins in 1603 (Keichō 8), at the dawn of the Edo period, in the town of Sakawa, Tosa Province (present-day Kochi Prefecture) [1] [2]. Following the Battle of Sekigahara, Yamauchi Kazutoyo was granted the Tosa domain, and his chief retainer, Fukao Shigeyoshi, was put in charge of the Sakawa area [3]. Shigeyoshi commissioned a sake shop, known as "御酒屋" (Goshuya), which was a privileged merchant allowed to use a surname and carry a sword, to be his personal sake producer [1] [3]. This Goshuya is the direct predecessor of the modern brewery, establishing a tradition of sake brewing in Sakawa that has continued for over 400 years [1].

A major milestone occurred in 1918 (Taishō 7), when the local sake brewers in Sakawa consolidated their operations to form a modern corporate entity, the current Tsukasabotan Brewing Company [3]. The brewery received its distinctive name from Count Mitsuaki Tanaka, a prominent figure from Sakawa, a former leader of the Rikuentai militia after the deaths of Ryoma Sakamoto and Shintaro Nakaoka, and later a Minister of the Imperial Household in the Meiji government [1] [3]. Tanaka, an avid drinker of the sake, declared it "the king of all flowers" and bestowed the name "Tsukasa Botan," meaning "Peony, the leader of all flowers" [1] [3].

The brewery has a deep cultural connection to the region's history, particularly its association with the great historical figures of Tosa, such as Ryoma Sakamoto [1] [2]. This heritage is further cemented by the brewery's prized possession, the "Hōjun Muhi no Maki" (Scroll of Unparalleled Richness), which contains calligraphy from Count Tanaka and a commendation from Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi in 1930 [3]. The brewery is known for embodying the "Tosa spirit" in its sake, which is characterized by a classic, clean, and extra-dry profile [1] [4].

Today, Tsukasabotan continues to operate from its historic location in Sakawa, maintaining its commitment to the traditional dry style of Tosa sake [1]. The brewery utilizes the pure underground water of the town and has gained recognition for its flagship brand, "Senchu Hassaku," which is named after a document written by Ryoma Sakamoto [1] [4]. The company also innovates with products like its popular Yuzushu, a low-alcohol sake blended with local mountain yuzu juice, demonstrating a blend of tradition and modern appeal [4].

## Yamamoto Honke

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1677 (Enpō 5 era)  
**Founder:** Genbee Yamamoto, the first of a line of family heads who have continuously adopted the name  
**Location:** Fushimi-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto-fu  
**Specialty:** Brewing with *Shiragikusui* (White Chrysanthemum Water), one of the Fushimi Seven Famous Waters. Developed pure yeast brewing technology in 1966, and produces 'Matsuno Midori,' the official sake for the Omote-senke tea ceremony meals.  

### History

Yamamoto Honke was established in 1677 (Enpō 5 era) by the first Genbee Yamamoto in the Fushimi district of Kyoto. The brewery's location is intrinsically linked to its product quality, as it was founded at the source of *Shiragikusui* (White Chrysanthemum Water), one of the famed "Seven Famous Waters of Fushimi." This water is renowned for its low iron content, making it exceptionally suitable for sake brewing. The family head has continuously adopted the name Genbee Yamamoto, signifying a commitment to the founding principles and heritage of the brewery.

The brewery's history is marked by resilience, notably surviving the tumultuous Battle of Toba-Fushimi in 1868. Although the brewery, along with much of the Fushimi area, was completely destroyed by fire during the conflict, the Yamamoto family demonstrated remarkable determination by rebuilding and resuming production within the same year. This event underscores the deep connection between the brewery and the local community. Following this period of reconstruction, the brewery expanded its reach significantly. Originally relying on water transport via the Takase and Yodo Rivers, the company capitalized on the development of railroads and automobiles in the Meiji and Taisho periods to extend its market eastward, establishing its signature brand, "Shinsei" (神聖), in the Tokyo area.

Beyond commercial success, Yamamoto Honke has cultivated a rich cultural heritage. The 8th generation head, Genbee Yamamoto (later known as Dōkō), was a noted man of culture with a profound interest in *Sado* (Japanese Tea Ceremony) and *Waka* (Japanese poetry). He was a close associate of the celebrated *Nihonga* artist Tomioka Tessai, who gifted the calligraphy for the "Shinsei" label as a wedding present for the 9th Genbee. This cultural connection continues today, as the brewery's premium "Matsuno Midori" (松の翠) series is the only official sake served at the *Chakaiseki* (tea ceremony meals) for the prestigious Omote-senke school of the Japanese Tea Ceremony.

In the modern era, the brewery has balanced tradition with innovation. In 1966, Yamamoto Honke was recognized for its pioneering work in biotechnology, developing a pure yeast brewing technique that earned it the prestigious EDA award, one of the highest honors in the Japanese brewing industry. This innovation led to the creation of the popular "Genbee-san no Onikoroshi" (Devil's Slayer) brand. Furthermore, in 1976, the company diversified its business by converting a part of the brewery into the *Torisei* pub, offering patrons a direct-from-the-brewery experience and further integrating the brewery into the local food culture of Fushimi.

## Yamanashi Meijo Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1750  
**Founder:** Ihee Kitahara, a descendant of a sake-brewing family from Takatō, Nagano  
**Location:** Daigahara, Hokuto City, Yamanashi Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Sparkling sake made with secondary fermentation in the bottle (méthode champenoise), utilizing pristine Hakushu water from the Japanese Alps (Mt. Kaikoma), and cultivating their own sake rice through a dedicated agricultural company.  

### History

Yamanashi Meijo, operating under the brand name Shichiken, was founded in 1750 (mid-Edo period) by Ihee Kitahara, a member of a sake-brewing family from Takatō in Nagano Prefecture [1] [2]. Kitahara was captivated by the exceptional quality of the local water in Daigahara, a post town on the historic Koshu Kaido route in what is now Yamanashi Prefecture [1]. The brewery's name, Shichiken (Seven Sages), originates from a pair of fanlights titled "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove" (Chikurin no Shichikenjin) gifted in 1835 by the local daimyo, Surugano-kami Naito, to celebrate the completion of the new main building [1].

The brewery holds a significant place in Japanese cultural history, notably serving as a lodging, or "Anzaisho," for Emperor Meiji during his imperial tour in 1880 [1]. This inner parlor was later designated as a historical landmark in 1933 [1]. In 1925, the 10th generation owner, Kosaburō Kitahara, formally established the corporation Yamanashi Meijo Co., Ltd., successfully growing it into the prefecture's largest sake business [1].

A major shift towards quality occurred in 1982 when the brewery discontinued the production of Futsū-shu (ordinary table sake) to focus exclusively on Toketei Meishō-shu (premium sake) [1]. This commitment to quality was further solidified in 1999 with the establishment of Onakaya, an agricultural limited company dedicated to cultivating high-quality sake rice in cooperation with local farmers [1]. In a demonstration of modern environmental responsibility, Yamanashi Meijo switched 100% of the electricity used in its sake production to renewable energy in 2022 [1].

The brewery has received international acclaim, winning multiple Gold Awards at prestigious events such as the Annual Japan Sake Awards and the U.S. National Sake Appraisal [3] [4]. A key modern innovation is their line of sparkling sake, which is produced using the traditional *méthode champenoise* (secondary fermentation in the bottle), a technique that has earned them a reputation for world-class quality and innovation in the sake industry [5].

## Yoshida Shuzoten Co., Ltd.

### Brewery Overview

**Founded:** 1870 (Meiji 3rd year)  
**Founder:** Unknown  
**Location:** Hakusan City, Ishikawa Prefecture  
**Specialty:** Traditional *kanzukuri* (winter brewing) method; use of pure water from the Tedori River and cold air from Mount Hakusan; featured in the 2015 documentary "The Birth of Sake"; new focus on the "Yoshidagura u" brand for natural and gentle sake.  

### History

Yoshida Shuzoten Co., Ltd., the brewery behind the renowned "Tedorigawa" brand, was established in 1870 (Meiji 3rd year) in the former Yamashima Village, now part of Hakusan City, Ishikawa Prefecture. The brewery was founded by a member of the Yoshida family, who have maintained ownership for seven generations. The location is strategically important, situated at the base of Mount Hakusan and on the alluvial fan of the Tedori River. This geography provides the brewery with two crucial elements for sake production: the pure, abundant underground water of the Tedori River for brewing and the cold, clean air from Mount Hakusan, which is ideal for the traditional winter brewing process known as *kanzukuri*. The company was formally incorporated in 1954.

For generations, the brewery has been dedicated to the labor-intensive, traditional methods of sake making. This commitment to artisanal production was brought to international attention in 2015 with the release of the documentary "The Birth of Sake," which chronicled the six-month winter brewing season at the brewery. The film highlighted the dedication of the *toji* (master brewer) and the *kurabito* (brewery workers), particularly the former *toji*, Yamamoto Teruyuki, and the then-young heir, Yasuyuki Yoshida. The brewery's philosophy centers on the concept of *wa-jō ryō-shu* (和醸良酒), meaning "good sake is brewed through harmony among people."

A major milestone in the brewery's recent history was the transition to the seventh generation of family leadership. Yasuyuki Yoshida, after training at a sake brewery in Yamagata Prefecture and gaining international experience, took over as President and *Toji* in 2020, marking the brewery's 150th anniversary. Under his leadership, the brewery has embraced a dual-brand strategy. The traditional "Tedorigawa" brand continues to honor the brewery's heritage, while the newer "Yoshidagura u" brand focuses on innovative, natural, and gentle sake, often using local rice like *Ishikawamon* and aligning with modern environmental consciousness.

Today, Yoshida Shuzoten stands as the sole remaining sake brewery in its immediate vicinity, a testament to its resilience and commitment to quality. The brewery continues to draw on its natural resources—the water of the Tedori River and the climate of Mount Hakusan—to produce sake that reflects the unique terroir of Ishikawa Prefecture, ensuring the continuation of a 150-year-old legacy while also pioneering new styles for the future of *jizake* (local sake).
