# Update Steering Documents

Update the project's steering documents with new insights, decisions, and learnings from development.

## Instructions

1. **Review Current State**
   - Read `.kiro/steering/product.md` for product vision
   - Read `.kiro/steering/tech.md` for technical architecture
   - Read `.kiro/steering/structure.md` for project organization

2. **Identify Updates Needed**
   - New features or capabilities added
   - Technical decisions made during development
   - Architecture changes or new integrations
   - Updated file structure or conventions

3. **Update Each Document**
   - **product.md**: Refine features, user journey, success criteria
   - **tech.md**: Add new technologies, update architecture, document patterns
   - **structure.md**: Update directory layout, new conventions, configuration changes

4. **Keep Documents Concise**
   - Focus on what's actually implemented
   - Remove speculative or planned-but-not-built items
   - Ensure accuracy with current codebase

## Usage

Invoke after completing major features or making significant technical decisions:
- After integrating new APIs or services
- When architecture patterns evolve
- After restructuring files or directories
- When product scope changes
