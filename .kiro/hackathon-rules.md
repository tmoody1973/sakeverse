## 🎯 **MANDATORY Kiro Usage Rules**

### **1. Use Steering Documents Throughout Development**
- ✅ Update `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md` as we build
- ✅ Reference steering docs in every major decision
- ✅ Show how steering guided architecture choices

### **2. Create & Use Custom Prompts for Everything**
- 🎯 **Development Workflow**: `@plan-rag`, `@implement-voice`, `@test-agent`
- 🎯 **Code Quality**: `@review-voice-code`, `@optimize-rag`  
- 🎯 **Documentation**: `@update-devlog`, `@write-readme`
- 🎯 **Testing**: `@test-voice-agent`, `@validate-rag`

### **3. Show Innovative Agent & MCP Usage**
- 🎯 **Custom Agents**: Specialized agents for voice, RAG, database
- 🎯 **MCP Integration**: Connect external tools and services
- 🎯 **Workflow Innovation**: Unique development patterns with Kiro

### **4. Document Everything in DEVLOG**
- ✅ Every Kiro command used and why
- ✅ How steering docs influenced decisions  
- ✅ Custom prompt creation and usage
- ✅ Agent and MCP integration process

## 📋 **Development Workflow with Kiro**

### **Phase 1: Planning (Always start here)**
```bash
@prime                    # Load project context
@plan-feature [feature]   # Plan with steering doc guidance
@update-steering         # Update steering docs with new insights
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation**
```bash
@execute [plan]          # Implement following steering guidelines
@review-code            # Quality check against standards
@update-devlog          # Document process and decisions
```

### **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
```bash
@test-feature           # Validate functionality
@optimize-performance   # Improve based on steering requirements
@document-learnings     # Update steering with new knowledge
```

### **Phase 4: Integration**
```bash
@integrate-systems      # Combine components following architecture
@validate-complete      # Check against product requirements
@prepare-demo          # Create presentation materials
```
