# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Sakéverse is an AI-powered sake discovery platform that bridges the gap between wine knowledge and sake exploration.

**Secondary**: Sake beginners overwhelmed by Japanese terminology who need a patient, voice-first guide
**Tertiary**: Intermediate sake drinkers tracking their journey and working toward certifications

All users benefit from conversational discovery rather than traditional search/filter interfaces, making sake exploration accessible and engaging.
