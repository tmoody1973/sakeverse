## The Problem

80M+ Americans drink wine. Most are terrified of sake menus.

I'm a certified sake professional, and I see it every day:
- Sake education is fragmented, academic, and intimidating
- Wine vocabulary doesn't translate ("Is Junmai like Pinot?")
- There's no bridge between curiosity and confident purchase

So I built one.

## Introducing Sakécosm 🍶

An AI-powered sake mastery platform that transforms beginners into connoisseurs.

Meet **Kiki** (利き酒 - "sake tasting") — your voice-first sake sommelier.

Tell Kiki you love Pinot Noir. She'll recommend an aged Junmai with similar earthy elegance.

Mention you're having ramen tonight. She'll suggest the perfect pairing and explain *why* it works.

## What Makes It Different

**🎤 Voice Sommelier**
Real conversations, not chatbots. Built on @OpenAI's Realtime API for sub-200ms responses. Ask anything, naturally.

**🎨 Dynamic UI**
Rich visual responses — sake cards, temperature guides, comparison tables — generated on the fly with @ThesysAI's C1.

**🗾 Interactive Japan Map**
Explore all 47 sake-producing prefectures. Click Niigata, learn why it's the "Burgundy of sake." AI-generated regional guides powered by @peraborgs.

**🍷 Wine Bridge**
The killer feature. Your wine preferences become sake recommendations. Chardonnay lover? Try Kimoto-style Junmai. Riesling fan? Nigori awaits.

**📚 Gamified Learning**
AI-generated courses. Quizzes. XP. 10 badge levels from "Sake Curious" to "Sake Grandmaster." Learning should be fun.

**🛒 Real Products**
Connected to @TippsySake's catalog — 100+ premium sakes with real images, prices, and one-click purchase.

## Try It

🌐 https://dynamous-kiro-hackathon.vercel.app

## The Vision

Sake shouldn't be intimidating. It should be an adventure.

Sakécosm is the guide I wish I had when I started my sake journey.

Now it exists for everyone.

🍶 Kanpai!
