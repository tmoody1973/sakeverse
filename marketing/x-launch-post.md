# Sakécosm X.com Post - Build in Public

---

## Main Post

Been building something for the past 3 days and I'm hyped to share it.

I'm a certified sake professional and I keep seeing the same thing: wine lovers curious about sake but completely lost when they see a menu. "Is Junmai like... Merlot?" 

So I built Sakécosm — an AI sake sommelier that actually speaks wine.

The voice agent is named Kiki (short for kikizake 利き酒, meaning "sake tasting"). You can literally tell her "I love Pinot Noir" and she'll explain which sake has that same earthy, elegant vibe.

Built with @OpenAI's realtime API so conversations feel natural, not robotic.

The catalog connects to @TippsySake — they're my go-to for quality sake and their product data made this possible. Real bottles, real prices, real purchase links.

Other stuff I crammed in:
- Interactive map of Japan's 47 sake regions (click a prefecture, get AI-generated info)
- Wine-to-sake translator 
- Gamified learning with XP and badges
- Dynamic UI that generates sake cards and comparisons on the fly

Tech stack for the nerds: Next.js 15, Convex, OpenAI Realtime, Thesys C1, Mapbox, Perplexity API. All built with @KiroDev CLI for the hackathon.

Try it: https://dynamous-kiro-hackathon.vercel.app

Ask Kiki something like "what sake pairs with ramen?" or "I like Sauvignon Blanc, help me out"

Still rough around the edges but the core is there. Sake shouldn't be intimidating — it should be fun to explore.

## Shorter Version (if needed)

3 days of building, finally sharing:

I'm a certified sake pro and wine lovers keep asking me "where do I even start with sake?"

So I built Sakécosm — an AI sommelier that translates wine preferences into sake recommendations.

Voice agent named Kiki (kikizake = sake tasting). Tell her you love Pinot Noir, she'll find you something with similar vibes.

Connected to @TippsySake's catalog for real products. Interactive Japan map. Gamified learning. The works.

Built with @OpenAI realtime API + @KiroDev CLI for the hackathon.
