# Instagram Post: Sakécosm Launch

## Caption

I just built something I wish existed when I first started exploring sake.

**Sakécosm** is an AI-powered sake discovery platform that makes Japanese sake accessible to everyone—whether you're a wine lover curious about sake, or a complete beginner intimidated by all the Japanese terminology.

### Why I Built This

As a **Certified Sake Professional**, I've spent years helping people discover sake. But I kept seeing the same barrier: people wanted to explore, but felt overwhelmed. The Japanese terms. The unfamiliar flavor profiles. Not knowing where to start.

So I built Sakécosm to bridge that gap.

### What Makes It Different

**🎤 Voice-First AI Sommelier (Kiki)**  
Talk naturally. Ask anything. "What sake should I try if I like Pinot Noir?" Kiki translates your wine preferences into sake recommendations. No intimidation. Just conversation.

**🗾 Interactive Japan Map**  
Click any prefecture. Discover local breweries, regional styles, and the stories behind every bottle. 50+ breweries mapped.

**🎓 Gamified Learning**  
Bite-sized courses. Earn XP. Unlock badges. Go from "Sake Curious" to "Sake Master" at your own pace.

**🎙️ Weekly Podcasts**  
4 shows. 5-minute episodes. Sake Stories. Pairing Lab. The Bridge. Brewing Secrets. Learn while you commute.

**🍜 Food Pairing Engine**  
Wondering what sake goes with Korean BBQ? Ramen? Sushi? The AI knows.

### The Tech Stack

Built in **27 hours** using Kiro CLI (AI-assisted development):
- OpenAI Realtime API for voice conversations
- Gemini for AI-generated content
- Next.js + Convex for real-time data
- Mapbox for interactive maps

This is what happens when you combine AI tools with domain expertise. I couldn't have built this solo in a month without Kiro—but with it, I shipped a full platform in just over a day of focused work.

### Why This Matters

Sake is one of the world's most sophisticated beverages, but it's often gatekept by complexity. I want to change that.

If you've ever been curious about sake but didn't know where to start, this is for you.

No credit card. No commitment. Just curiosity.
