### Maker Information

**Name:** Tarik Moody

**Bio:**
Certified Sake Professional | AI Builder | Former Public Radio Host | Building tools that make complex things accessible

**Why I Built This:**
As a Certified Sake Professional, I've spent years helping people discover sake. But I kept seeing the same barrier: people wanted to explore, but felt overwhelmed by Japanese terminology and unfamiliar flavor profiles. So I built an AI sommelier that bridges the gap—translating wine preferences into sake recommendations and making sake accessible to everyone.

🎤 Voice-first conversations (OpenAI Realtime API)
🍷 Wine-to-sake translations
🗾 Interactive Japan brewery map
🎓 Gamified learning with badges

## Engagement Responses

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is this really free?"**
A: Yes! 100% free forever. No credit card required. I built this to make sake accessible, not to gatekeep behind paywalls.

**Q: "How accurate are the recommendations?"**
A: Very! I'm a Certified Sake Professional, and I've trained the AI on my expertise plus extensive sake literature. The wine-to-sake translations are based on actual flavor profiles and characteristics.

**Q: "Can I buy sake through the app?"**
A: Not directly, but we link to Tippsy (a great online sake retailer) where you can purchase. We're focused on education and discovery, not e-commerce.

**Q: "What if I don't know anything about wine either?"**
A: Perfect! Kiki can guide you based on any preferences—foods you like, flavors you enjoy, or just "I want something easy to drink." No wine knowledge required.

**Q: "How did you build this so fast?"**
A: Kiro CLI (AI-assisted development) was a game-changer. It helped me write code, connect APIs, and debug issues. As someone with basic coding knowledge, I couldn't have built this without AI assistance.

**Q: "Is the voice feature available on mobile?"**
A: Yes! Works on both desktop and mobile browsers. Just tap the mic button and start talking.

**Q: "Do you have an app?"**
A: It's a web app (PWA), so you can add it to your home screen and use it like a native app. No download required.
