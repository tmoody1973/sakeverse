Hi Tippsy Team,

I'm Tarik Moody, a developer and sake enthusiast. I wanted to share a project I've been building for the **Kiro Hackathon** (January 2026) that prominently features Tippsy's product catalog.

## The Problem I'm Solving

**Wine enthusiasts curious about sake are overwhelmed by Japanese terminology and unfamiliar flavor profiles.** They don't know where to start, what "Junmai Daiginjo" means, or how their love of Pinot Noir might translate to sake preferences.

The sake industry has an accessibility problem—not because the product isn't amazing, but because the learning curve feels steep. I believe AI can bridge this gap and bring more people into the world of sake.

## What I Built: Sakécosm

**Sakécosm** is an AI-powered sake discovery platform featuring **Kiki** (利き酒 - "sake tasting"), a voice-first sommelier that helps users discover sake through natural conversation.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://sakecosm.com

### How Tippsy Products Are Integrated

I've integrated **104 Tippsy products** throughout the platform:

1. **Voice Recommendations** - When users ask Kiki for sake recommendations, she searches your product catalog using semantic AI (vector embeddings) and returns real Tippsy products with images, prices, and direct purchase links.

2. **Wine-to-Sake Bridge** - Users who say "I like Pinot Noir" get matched to appropriate sake from your catalog. The AI translates wine preferences into sake recommendations.

3. **Food Pairing Engine** - When users ask about pairing sake with sushi, ramen, or BBQ, the system recommends specific Tippsy products that complement those dishes.

4. **Discover Page** - A browsable catalog of all 104 products with filters by category, price, and region—all linking back to Tippsy for purchase.

5. **AI Podcast Network** - Our "This American Life" style podcasts mention specific Tippsy products when discussing breweries and pairings, with links in the episode notes.

6. **User Library** - Users can save favorite sake to their personal library, with one-click access to purchase on Tippsy.

7. **Personalized Dashboard** - Based on user preferences, the homepage shows recommended Tippsy products tailored to their taste profile.

### The Technology

- **Multi-Layer RAG System** - 5 AI knowledge sources including your product data, sake books, brewery histories, and live web search
- **Voice-First Experience** - Real-time voice conversations using OpenAI's Realtime API
- **Gamified Learning** - Courses, quizzes, and badges to make sake education engaging
- **Interactive Japan Map** - Explore 47 prefectures and discover regional sake styles

## Why I'm Reaching Out

I built this for a hackathon, but I genuinely believe this type of AI-powered discovery could help grow the sake market by making it accessible to wine lovers and curious beginners.

I'd love to:
- Get your feedback on the integration
- Discuss if there's potential for a more formal partnership
- Hear your thoughts on what would make this more valuable for Tippsy customers

I'm not asking for anything—just wanted to share what I built and see if it resonates with your mission of bringing sake to more people.

Thank you for building such a great product catalog and making sake accessible. Your data made this project possible.

Best regards,
