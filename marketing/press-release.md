**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## Sakécosm Launches AI-Powered Platform to Bridge Wine Enthusiasts into the World of Japanese Sake

*Voice-first sommelier "Kiki" uses advanced AI to translate wine preferences into personalized sake recommendations, addressing the industry's accessibility challenge*

**January 2026** — Sakécosm, a new AI-powered sake discovery platform, officially launches today with a mission to make Japanese sake accessible to the millions of wine enthusiasts curious about expanding their palate but intimidated by unfamiliar terminology and flavor profiles.

The platform introduces **Kiki** (利き酒 — Japanese for "sake tasting"), a voice-first AI sommelier that engages users in natural conversation to understand their preferences and deliver personalized sake recommendations in real-time.

### Addressing the Sake Industry's Accessibility Gap

Despite sake's growing popularity in Western markets, the category faces a significant barrier: the learning curve. Terms like "Junmai Daiginjo," "Yamahai," and "Seimaibuai" create friction for newcomers, while the lack of familiar reference points makes it difficult for wine lovers to know where to start.

"Wine enthusiasts already have sophisticated palates—they just need a bridge," said Tarik Moody, creator of Sakécosm. "When someone tells Kiki they love Pinot Noir, she immediately understands they might appreciate an aged Junmai or Koshu with similar earthy, elegant characteristics. That translation is what's been missing."

### Platform Features

**Voice-First Discovery**  
Powered by OpenAI's Realtime API, Kiki conducts natural voice conversations with sub-200ms latency, allowing users to ask questions and receive recommendations as they would from a human sommelier.

**Wine-to-Sake Translation Engine**  
A proprietary AI system maps wine preferences to sake styles, enabling instant recommendations based on users' existing knowledge. Chardonnay lovers are guided toward Kimoto-style sake; Champagne enthusiasts discover sparkling sake.

**AI-Generated Podcast Network**  
Four weekly shows—*Sake Stories*, *Pairing Lab*, *The Bridge*, and *Brewing Secrets*—deliver "This American Life"-style educational content featuring two AI hosts: TOJI (the master brewer guide) and KOJI (the curious explorer).

**Interactive Japan Map**  
Users explore all 47 prefectures to discover regional sake styles, from Niigata's crisp tanrei karakuchi to Hiroshima's soft, gentle brews, with AI-generated descriptions for each region.

**Gamified Learning System**  
Structured courses with quizzes allow users to progress from "Sake Curious" to "Sake Grandmaster" across 10 badge levels, earning XP for completing chapters and passing assessments.

### Technology Stack

Sakécosm employs a sophisticated five-layer RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture:
- Vector search across 104 curated sake products
- Wine-to-sake knowledge base with 13 preference mappings
- Food pairing recommendations from 9 expert-curated knowledge chunks
- Deep knowledge from 5 digitized sake reference books and 68 brewery histories
- Real-time web search for current trends and news

### Industry Integration

The platform currently features products from Tippsy Sake's catalog, with direct purchase links enabling seamless conversion from discovery to transaction. Sakécosm is actively seeking partnerships with sake importers, distributors, and retailers interested in AI-powered customer education and acquisition.

### Availability

Sakécosm is available now at **https://sakecosm.com** as a free platform. The service requires no download and works across desktop and mobile browsers.

### About Sakécosm
